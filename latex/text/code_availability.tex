\chapter{Code and data availability}

I've spent quite a bit of effort making this entire thesis easily reproducible from the raw data. To that end, the source code and data are published on GitHub, at \url{https://github.com/wduverger/msc-thesis}. If you want to generate all figures, you'll need to install a number of Python libraries in your environment (\ttfamily python-bioformats\rmfamily\ and \ttfamily python-opencv\rmfamily, among others). These packages have quite a lot of dependencies and can be tricky to install. If that is the case, or you just want to try to run the code without messing with your system too much, you can install Docker and build a container, a custom Linux virtual machine, with the Dockerfile in the GitHub repository.. 

If you experience any trouble setting this up, have any questions regarding this thesis or just want to chat about polarisation microscopy in general, do not be afraid to reach out! I am happy to help.
