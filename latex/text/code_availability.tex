\chapter{Code and data availability}

I've spent quite a bit of effort ensuring this entire thesis easily reproducible from the raw data. To that end, the source code and data necessary to produce this file and the figures in it are published on GitHub, at \url{https://github.com/wduverger/msc-thesis}. 
If you experience any trouble getting the code to run, have any questions regarding this thesis or just want to chat about polarisation microscopy in general, please reach out! I am always happy to help.
