\begin{figure}[ht]

	\includegraphics{laser_power}
	\caption{
		The power of each of the three lasers as measured through a 10x objective. Notice the non-linearity at low power settings. The 775 nm data was scaled down by three orders of magnitude.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics{laser_polarisation}
	\caption{
		Polarisation characterisation of the different lasers. To characterise circular polarisation, a polariser was placed in the sample and scanned from \ang{0} to \ang{180} in steps of \ang{20} (notice that I forgot to sample \ang{260} in the 775 nm data). Linear polarisation was characterised by fixing the polariser in place at \ang{0} and scanning the laser itself from \ang{0} to \ang{180} in steps of \ang{10}. Dark blue: average over 200 samples, light blue: raw data.

	\caption{
		Simulation of the effect of QWP alignment on the action of the detection pathway. Shown are three simulations in which the first QWP is rotated by 0, 30, and 90 degrees, respectively. The second QWP is always rotated by 0, and the HWP is rotated to half the rotation angle (x-axis). When the QWPs have an offset of 90 degrees (bottom), the upper and lower panels (with either P1 or P2 constant) are identical, but when they are aligned (top), there is a phase difference. When they are not aligned at all (middle), intensity variations are prominent. This simulation is based on \autoref{eq:detection waveplates}.
