\chapter{Outlook}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Conventional polarisation microscopy
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Figure out detection waveplates, otherwise you can't use polarisation in the detection pathway
		
		\item I've made some measurements of polarisation sensitivities etc. We need to set up an analysis pipeline that makes use of them to correct systematic data errors before we can make quantitative statements about sample polarisation. Then we should really compare it to data from another lab and see if it matches.
		
		\item As part of that, tune the 640 and 775 waveplates to increase linearity to match the 561 laser.
		
		\item Improve the excitation waveplate calibration.		
	\end{itemize}

	\item Keep developing pSTED
	
	\item Other fancy polarisation stuff: FLIM + pol, FRET measurements, ...
	
	\item To do actual biological research, conventional pol microscopy is definitely the way to go. sSTED is easier than pSTED (for now).
