abstract = {Cell-free studies have demonstrated how collective action of actin-associated proteins can organize actin filaments into dynamic patterns, such as vortices, asters and stars. Using complementary microscopic techniques, we here show evidence of such self-organization of the actin cortex in living HeLa cells. During cell adhesion, an active multistage process naturally leads to pattern transitions from actin vortices over stars into asters. This process is primarily driven by Arp2/3 complex nucleation, but not by myosin motors, which is in contrast to what has been theoretically predicted and observed in vitro. Concomitant measurements of mechanics and plasma membrane fluidity demonstrate that changes in actin patterning alter membrane architecture but occur functionally independent of macroscopic cortex elasticity. Consequently, tuning the activity of the Arp2/3 complex to alter filament assembly may thus be a mechanism allowing cells to adjust their membrane architecture without affecting their macroscopic mechanical properties.},

abstract = {The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, causing intractable infections, has resulted in an increased interest in phage therapy. Phage therapy preceded antibiotic treatment against bacterial infections and involves the use of bacteriophages, bacterial viruses, to fight bacteria. Virulent phages are abundant and have proven to be very effective in vitro, where they in most cases lyse any bacteria within the hour. Clinical trials on animals and humans show promising results but also that the treatments are not completely effective. This is partly due to the studies being carried out with few phages, and with limited experimental groups, but also the fact that phage therapy has limitations in vivo. Phages are large compared with small antibiotic molecules, and each phage can only infect one or a few bacterial strains. A very large number of different phages are needed to treat infections as these are caused by genetically different strains of bacteria. Phages are effective only if enough of them can reach the bacteria and increase in number in situ. Taken together, this entails high demands on resources for the construction of phage libraries and the testing of individual phages. The effectiveness and host range must be characterized, and immunological risks must be assessed for every single phage.},

abstract = {The l-tryptophan degradation product indole is a purported extracellular signaling molecule that influences biofilm formation in various bacteria. Here we analyzed the mechanisms of indole production in Fusobacterium nucleatum and the effects of tryptophan and indole on F. nucleatum planktonic and biofilm cells. The amino acid sequence deduced from the fn1943 gene in F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 was 28{\%} identical to that deduced from tnaA in Escherichia coli, which encodes tryptophanase catalyzing the beta-elimination of l-tryptophan to produce indole. The fn1943 gene was cotranscribed with the downstream gene fn1944, which is a homolog of tnaB encoding low-affinity tryptophan permease. The transcript started at position -68 or -153 from the first nucleotide of the fn1943 translation initiation codon. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that much more F. nucleatum fn1943 transcripts were obtained from log-phase cells than from stationary-phase cells. Indole production by the purified recombinant protein encoded by fn1943 was examined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The K(m) and k(cat) of the enzyme were 0.26 +/- 0.03 mM and 0.74 +/- 0.04 s(-1), respectively. F. nucleatum biofilm formation and the biofilm supernatant concentration of indole increased dose dependently with increasing tryptophan concentrations. Exogenous indole also increased F. nucleatum biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. Even at very high concentrations, tryptophan did not affect fn1943 expression, whereas similar indole concentrations decreased expression. Thus, exogenous tryptophan and indole were suggested to increase F. nucleatum biofilms.},

abstract = {The process of a bacteriophage attaching to its host cell is a combination of physical diffusion, biochemical surface interactions, and reaction-induced conformational changes in receptor proteins. Local variations in the physico-chemical properties of the medium, the phage's mode of action, and the physiology of the host cell also all influence adsorption kinetics. These characteristics can affect a specific phage's binding capabilities and the susceptibility of the host cell to phage attack. Despite the complexity of this process, describing adsorption kinetics of a population of bacteriophages binding to a culture of cells has been accomplished with relatively simple equations governed by the laws of mass-action. Many permutations and modifications to the basic set of reactions have been suggested through the years. While no single solution emerges as a universal answer, this review provides the fundamentals of current phage adsorption modeling and will guide researchers in the selection of valid, appropriate models.},

While the basic physical principles of 'super-resolution' imaging were discovered in the 1990s, with initial experimental demonstrations following in 2000, the broad application of super-resolution imaging to address cell-biological questions has only more recently emerged. Nanoscopy approaches have begun to facilitate discoveries in cell biology and to add new knowledge. One current direction for method improvement is the ambition to quantitatively account for each molecule under investigation and assess true molecular colocalization patterns via multi-colour analyses. In pursuing this goal, the labelling of individual molecules to enable their visualization has emerged as a central challenge. Extending nanoscale imaging into (sliced) tissue and whole-Animal contexts is a further goal. In this Review we describe the successes to date and discuss current obstacles and possibilities for further development.},

@article{Burn2017,
abstract = {The endothelium provides a strong barrier separating circulating blood from tissue. It also provides a significant challenge for immune cells in the bloodstream to access potential sites of infection. To mount an effective immune response, leukocytes traverse the endothelial layer in a process known as transendothelial migration. Decades of work have allowed dissection of the mechanisms through which immune cells gain access into peripheral tissues, and subsequently to inflammatory foci. However, an often under-appreciated or potentially ignored question is whether transmigrated leukocytes can leave these inflammatory sites, and perhaps even return across the endothelium and re-enter circulation. Although evidence has existed to support “reverse” transendothelial migration for a number of years, it is only recently that mechanisms associated with this process have been described. Here we review the evidence that supports both reverse transendothelial migration and reverse interstitial migration within tissues, with particular emphasis on some of the more recent studies that finally hint at potential mechanisms. Additionally, we postulate the biological significance of retrograde migration, and whether it serves as an additional mechanism to limit pathology, or provides a basis for the dissemination of systemic inflammation.},

abstract = {Fluorescence polarization is widely used to assess the orientation/rotation of molecules, and the excitation energy transfer between closely located chromophores. Emerging since the 1990s, single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging stimulate the application of light polarization for studying molecular organization and energy transfer beyond ensemble averaging. Here, traditional fluorescence polarization and linear dichroism methods used for bulk samples are compared with techniques specially developed for, or inspired by, single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy. Techniques for assessing energy transfer in anisotropic samples, where the traditional fluorescence anisotropy framework is not readily applicable, are discussed in depth. It is shown that the concept of a polarization portrait and the single funnel approximation can lay the foundation for alternative energy transfer metrics. Examples ranging from fundamental studies of photoactive materials (conjugated polymers, light-harvesting aggregates, and perovskite semiconductors) to F{\"{o}}rster resonant energy transfer (FRET)-based biomedical imaging are presented. Furthermore, novel uses of light polarization for super-resolution optical imaging are mentioned as well as strategies for avoiding artifacts in polarization microscopy.},

New hardware and software tools have made crystallography appear to be an almost routine (but still far from being analytical) technique and many structures are now being determined by scientists with very limited experience in the practical aspects of the field. However, this apparent ease is sometimes illusory and proper procedures need to be followed to maintain high standards of structure quality.

abstract = {In bacteria, several physiological processes once thought to be the products of uniformly dispersed reactions are now known to be highly asymmetric, with some exhibiting interesting geometric localizations. In particular, the cell envelope of Escherichia coli displays a form of subcellular differentiation in which peptidoglycan and outer membrane proteins at the cell poles remain stable for generations while material in the lateral walls is diluted by growth and turnover. To determine if material in the side walls was organized in any way, we labeled outer membrane proteins with succinimidyl ester-linked fluorescent dyes and then grew the stained cells in the absence of dye. Labeled proteins were not evenly dispersed in the envelope but instead appeared as helical ribbons that wrapped around the outside of the cell. By staining the O8 surface antigen of E. coli 2443 with a fluorescent derivative of concanavalin A, we observed a similar helical organization for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component of the outer membrane. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicated that some of the outer membrane proteins remained freely diffusible in the side walls and could also diffuse into polar domains. On the other hand, the LPS O antigen was virtually immobile. Thus, the outer membrane of E. coli has a defined in vivo organization in which a subfraction of proteins and LPS are embedded in stable domains at the poles and along one or more helical ribbons that span the length of this gram-negative rod. The idea that bacteria might be no more than small sacks of enzymes and substrates mixed together in an amorphous jum-ble has given way to the realization that many proteins, pro-cesses, and macromolecules have geometrically diverse loca-tions and exhibit asymmetric behaviors. One example of this changing concept is that in Escherichia coli the cell poles can be considered to be distinctive organelles in which neither pepti-doglycan nor outer membrane (OM) proteins are recycled or diluted (9, 10, 12, 26). Numerous proteins or physiological complexes congregate exclusively at one or both poles, with implications for protein secretion, environmental sensing, cel-lular development, virulence, and gene transfer (14, 19, 31, 54, 55). Furthermore, one or more of these asymmetries may reg-ulate bacterial morphology because inaccurate localization of extraneous pole-like domains produces cells with aberrant shapes (12, 44). Another surprising facet of prokaryotic structure is that sev-eral proteins assemble in long filaments that spiral across the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane, reaching from one end of the cell to the other. The MreB and Mbl proteins form such fibrils, or cables, in Bacillus subtilis (22) and Caulobacter crescentus (17) and may serve as internal scaffolds that position peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes, thereby defining the shape of the cell wall (17, 29, 33). The MinCD proteins oscil-late from pole to pole along helical paths, inhibiting polymer-ization of the principal cell division protein FtsZ and helping to define the cell's center (56). FtsZ itself moves from completed septa to new division sites by traveling along helical pathways on the inner membrane (1, 58), and even nonassembled FtsZ monomers oscillate back and forth along helical tracks (60). DNA dispersal at cell division also relies on proteins with helical distributions: the SetB protein is required for proper chromosomal segregation in E. coli (16), and the ParA protein moves along spiral-shaped threads to segregate R1 plasmids (13). And finally, the SecA and SecY secretion complexes are distributed in helical fashion in the inner membrane of B. subtilis (4), although this may not be true in E. coli (3). Except for the Sec proteins, the other spiraling proteins seem to share the common function of partitioning some substance—shape elements (MreB and Mbl), cell volume (MinCD and FtsZ), or DNA (SetB and ParA)—so that the materials are distributed uniformly to daughter cells after division. One question that arises is whether one of the above pro-teins creates the principal scaffold on which the others assem-ble or travel, or if there is an underlying helical structure in which proteins move independently. A recent observation hints at the importance of the latter possibility. Gibbs et al. found that in E. coli newly synthesized LamB protein diffuses throughout the OM in a helical fashion (20). This behavior implies the existence of long-lived spiral boundaries that re-strict the diffusion of LamB, and perhaps other surface pro-teins, to defined OM " canals. " However, the OM has been considered to be continuous and homogeneous, and no obvi-ous structure has been observed that might serve such a pur-pose. On the other hand, polar domains constitute an excep-tion to the idea of the uniformity of the OM (9, 12). Since an unknown mechanism maintains this distinction between the poles and the cell cylinder, another overlooked structure(s) may exist in the cell envelope as well. In this work we ask whether components of the OM have},

Oxidiative stress and metal rich environments have been implicated in triggering assembly. Here, we have explored the composition of Lewy bodies in postmortem tissue using electron microscopy and immunogold labeling and revealed dityrosine crosslinks in Lewy bodies in brain tissue from PD patients. In vitro, we show that dityrosine cross-links in $\alpha$-syn are formed by covalent ortho-ortho coupling of two tyrosine residues under conditions of oxidative stress by fluorescence and confirmed using mass-spectrometry. A covalently cross-linked dimer isolated by SDS-PAGE and mass analysis showed that dityrosine dimer was formed via the coupling of Y39-Y39 to give a homo dimer peptide that may play a key role in formation of oligomeric and seeds for fibril formation. Atomic force microscopy analysis reveals that the covalent dityrosine contributes to the stabilization of $\alpha$-syn assemblies. Thus, the presence of oxidative stress induced dityrosine could play an important role in assembly and toxicity of $\alpha$-syn in PD.},

Cytoskeleton and ligand-bound integrins orient in the same direction as retrograde actin flow with their cytoskeleton-binding $\beta$-subunits tilted by applied force. The measurements demonstrate that intracellular forces can orient cell surface integrins and support a molecular model of integrin activation by cytoskeletal force.

abstract = {Adsorption of $\lambda$-phage on sensitive bacteria Escherichia coli is a classical problem but not all issues have been resolved. One of the outstanding problems is the rate of adsorption, which in some cases appears to exceed the theoretical limit imposed by the law of random diffusion. We revisit this problem by conducting experiments along with new theoretical analyses. Our measurements show that upon incubating $\lambda$-phage with bacteria Ymel, the population of unbound phage in a salt buffer decreases with time and in general obeys a double-exponential function characterized by a fast ($\tau$1) and a slow ($\tau$2) decay time. We found that both the fast and the slow processes are specific to interactions between l-phage and its receptor LamB. Such specificity motivates a kinetic model that describes the interaction between the phage and the receptor as an on-and-off process followed by an irreversible binding. The latter may be a signature of the initiation of DNA translocation. The kinetic model successfully predicts the double exponential behavior seen in the experiment and allows the corresponding rate constants to be extracted from single measurements. The weak temperature dependence of the reversible and the irreversible binding rate suggests that phage retention by the receptor is entropic in nature and that a molecular key-lock interaction may be an appropriate description of the interaction between the phage tail and the receptor. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Homologous recombination (HR) is required for accurate chromosome segregation during the first meiotic division and constitutes a key repair and tolerance pathway for complex DNA damage, including DNA double-strand breaks, interstrand crosslinks, and DNA gaps. In addition, recombination and replication are inextricably linked, as recombination recovers stalled and broken replication forks, enabling the evolution of larger genomes/replicons. Defects in recombination lead to genomic instability and elevated cancer predisposition, demonstrating a clear cellular need for recombination. However, recombination can also lead to genome rearrangements. Unrestrained recombination causes undesired endpoints (translocation, deletion, inversion) and the accumulation of toxic recombination intermediates. Evidently, HR must be carefully regulated to match specific cellular needs. Here, we review the factors and mechanistic stages of recombination that are subject to regulation and suggest that recombination achieves flexibility and robustness by proceeding through metastable, reversible intermediates.},

abstract = {There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic approach regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process which is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the reaction-rate equations); the stochastic approach regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process which is governed by a single dif- ferential-difference equation (the master equation). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this stochastic simulation algorithm correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by finite time steps At. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

The present paper reviews single-crystal experiments conducted under isothermal, low pressure conditions (p {\textless} 10-3 mbar). Two different reaction systems have been investigated: catalytic CO oxidation on various Pt and Pd orientations and catalytic NO reduction on Pt(100) using CO, H2, or NH3 as the reducing agent. The different reaction systems exhibit a wide variety of interesting phenomena which are well-known in nonlinear dynamics, for example, such as spatiotemporal pattern formation, the existence of Turing structures and the appearance of deterministic chaos, and chemical turbulence. The mechanistic steps leading to the observed phenomena have been investigated and appropriate mathematical models have been formulated and analyzed using bifurcation theory. The driving force for the rate oscillations has been shown to result from structural changes of the substrate in the case of catalytic CO oxidation on Pt surfaces, subsurface oxygen formation in the case of catalytic CO oxidation on Pd surfaces, and in the chemical reaction network described by a vacancy model in the case of the NO reduction reactions. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

The tail fibers of mutant whiskerless (wac) phage still retract under the first two conditions, but not the last three. Antibodies to whiskers neutralize T4, probably by fixing tail fibers in the retracted configuration. Phage with retracted tail fibers adsorb poorly to host bacterial cells, and their adsorption rate increases as the fibers become extended. These results suggest that one function of the whiskers is to retract the tail fibers and thereby prevent adsorption to host cells under certain conditions that might be unfavorable for production of phage progeny following infection.},

Detailed information regarding amyloid fibrils' assembly mechanism, functional properties, disease association, and nano-mechanical characteristics can be gained from studies of their length distribution. Such statistical characterization of fibril length will contribute to the future development of improved therapies targeting amyloid-associated disease and novel amyloid-based nano-materials. Nano-scale microscopy visualization of amyloid fibrils allows direct measurement of the length of individual fibril particles deposited on the surface of substrates. However, quantitative characterization of the detailed length distributions of amyloid fibrils in bulk samples is far from straightforward. In this chapter, I describe a method, based on the analysis of atomic force microscopy images, which enables the quantitative characterization of amyloid fibril length distributions in bulk fibril samples. This is illustrated by using amyloid fibril samples generated in vitro from $\beta$2-microglobulin. I discuss the practical considerations in determining fibril length distribution, including sample preparation, image acquisition, fibril tracing, length-dependent bias correction, and distribution analysis. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The aggregation of proteins into structures known as amyloids is observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Amyloids are composed of pairs of tightly interacting, many stranded and repetitive intermolecular $\beta$-sheets, which form the cross-$\beta$-sheet structure. This structure enables amyloids to grow by recruitment of the same protein and its repetition can transform a weak biological activity into a potent one through cooperativity and avidity. Amyloids therefore have the potential to self-replicate and can adapt to the environment, yielding cell-to-cell transmissibility, prion infectivity and toxicity.},

abstract = {Transmissible amyloid particles called prions are associated with infectious prion diseases in mammals and inherited phenotypes in yeast. All amyloid aggregates can give rise to potentially infectious seeds that accelerate their growth. Why some amyloid seeds are highly infectious prion particles while others are less infectious or even inert, is currently not understood. To address this question, we analyzed the suprastructure and dimensions of synthetic amyloid fibrils assembled from the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) prion protein Sup35NM. We then quantified the ability of these particles to induce the [PSI+] prion phenotype in cells. Our results show a striking relationship between the length distribution of the amyloid fibrils and their ability to induce the heritable [PSI+] prion phenotype. Using a simple particle size threshold model to describe transfection activity, we explain how dimensions of amyloid fibrils are able to modulate their infectious potential as prions.},

Rather, it is intended to lay a conceptual foundation by which magnetic resonance image formation can be understood from an intuitive perspective. The presentation is nonmathematical, relying on simple models that take the reader progressively from the basic spin physics of nuclei, through descriptions of how the magnetic resonance signal is generated and detected in an MRI scanner, the foundations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation, and a discussion of the Fourier transform and its relation to MR image formation.

Nevertheless, the overlaying organization of actin in neurons and in the axon initial segment (AIS) is still unclear, due mainly to a lack of adequate imaging methods. By harnessing live-cell stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy and the fluorescent probe SiR-Actin, we show that the periodic subcortical actin structure is in fact present in both axons and dendrites. The periodic cytoskeleton organization is also found in the peripheral nervous system, specifically at the nodes of Ranvier. The actin patches in the AIS co-localize with pre-synaptic markers. Cytosolic actin organization strongly depends on the developmental stage and subcellular localization. Altogether, the results of this study reveal unique neuronal cytoskeletal features.},

abstract = {The coalescence of proteins into highly ordered aggregates is a hallmark of protein misfolding disorders (PMDs), which, when affecting the central nervous system, lead to progressive neurodegeneration. Although the chemical identity and the topology of each culprit protein are unique, the principles governing aggregation and propagation are strikingly stereotypical. It is now clear that such protein aggregates can spread from cell to cell and eventually affect entire organ systems - similarly to prion diseases. However, because most aggregates are not found to transmit between individuals, they are not infectious sensu strictiori. Therefore, they are not identical to prions and we prefer to define them as 'prionoids'. Here we review recent advances in understanding the toxicity of protein aggregation affecting the brain. Protein misfolding and aggregation is the root cause of many neurodegenerative disorders. Data implicate oligomeric species in the initiation and propagation of toxicity and in their own self-propagation.Although chemically disparate, toxic oligomers in various disorders activate similar downstream pathways, suggesting that a limited number of common mechanisms may lead to cytotoxicity.Pathological protein aggregates use many different cellular mechanisms to spread within organisms. Exosomes may be exploited as Trojan horses by these entities. Several nonconventional pathways may also play a role in the export of oligomeric units, including tunneling nanotubes.Pathological oligomers can use classical endocytic routes for entry into the cell. However, some oligomers may interact with the plasma membrane and gain entry through nonconventional routes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Chemical Society. Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) are crystals with the structural formula ABX 3 , where A, B, and X are organic and inorganic ions, respectively. While known for several decades, HOIPs have only in recent years emerged as extremely promising semiconducting materials for solar energy applications. In particular, power-conversion efficiencies of HOIP-based solar cells have improved at a record speed and, after only little more than 6 years of photovoltaics research, surpassed the 20{\%} threshold, which is an outstanding result for a solution-processable material. It is thus of fundamental importance to reveal physical and chemical phenomena that contribute to, or limit, these impressive photovoltaic efficiencies.To understand charge-transport and light-absorption properties of semiconducting materials, one often invokes a lattice of ions displaced from their static positions only by harmonic vibrations. However, a preponderance of recent studies suggests that this picture is not sufficient for HOIPs, where a variety of structurally dynamic effects, beyond small harmonic vibrations, arises already at room temperature.In this Account, we focus on these effects. First, we review structure and bonding in HOIPs and relate them to the promising charge-transport and absorption properties of these materials, in terms of favorable electronic properties. We point out that HOIPs are much "softer" mechanically, compared to other efficient solar-cell materials, and that this can result in large ionic displacements at room temperature. We therefore focus next on dynamic structural effects in HOIPs, going beyond a static band-structure picture. Specifically, we discuss pertinent experimental and theoretical findings as to phase-transition behavior and molecular/octahedral rearrangements. We then discuss atomic diffusion phenomena in HOIPs, with an emphasis on the migration of intrinsic and extrinsic ionic species. From this combined perspective, HOIPs appear as highly dynamic materials, in which structural fluctuations and long-range ionic motion have an unusually strong impact on charge-transport and optical properties. We highlight the potential implications of these effects for several intriguing phenomenological observations, ranging from scattering mechanisms and lifetimes of charge carriers to light-induced structural effects and ionic conduction.

Here, we directly observe this entire process by using single-molecule fluorescence assays to study Cas12a from Acidaminococcus sp. (AsCas12a). We determine that AsCas12a ribonucleopro-teins search for their on-target site by a one-dimensional diffusion along elongated DNA molecules and induce cleavage in the two DNA strands in a well-defined order, beginning with the non-target strand. Furthermore, the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) for AsCas12a makes only a limited contribution of DNA unwinding during R-loop formation and shows a negligible role in the process of DNA cleavage, in contrast to the Cas9 PAM.},

abstract = {The value of teams in new product development (NPD) is undeniable. Both the interdisciplinary nature of the work and industry trends necessitate that professionals from different functions work together on development projects to create the highest-quality product in the shortest time. Understanding the conditions that facilitate teamwork has been a pursuit of researchers for nearly a half century. The present paper reviews existing literature on teams and team learning in organizational behavior and technology and innovation to offer insights for research on NPD teams. Building on prior work, the organizational benefits of NPD teams are summarized, and five attributes of these teams are identified that hinder attainment of their potential: (1) project complexity; (2) cross-functionality; (3) temporary membership; (4) fluid team boundaries; and (5) embeddedness in organizational structures. It is argued here that effective management of these five attributes allows not only organization-level benefits but also team-level benefits in the form of new capabilities and team member resilience. The critical roles of leadership and of communication and conflict management training are then highlighted as strategies for overcoming the challenges to team effectiveness in NPD as well as for realizing five team benefits: (1) project management skills; (2) broad perspective; (3) teaming skills; (4) expanded social network; and (5) boundary-spanning skills. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these ideas for conducting future team research. {\textcopyright} 2009 Product Development {\&} Management Association.},

We report here that Brca1-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells have impaired repair of chromosomal DSBs by homologous recombination. The relative frequencies of homologous and nonhomologous DNA integration and DSB repair were also altered.

This paper focuses on the development of conflict in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi and Syria under Bashar al-Assad in order to flesh out distinctions and interactions between uprisings, revolution, and civil war. My research first standardizes a conceptual definition of civil war from a long-standing scholarly debate. The presence or absence of civil war is examined in correlation to five specific independent variables drawn from the cases and past examinations of civil war: the nature of the governmental regime, territoriality of the conflict, militarization of the opposing sides, international influence, and regional players. Using Mill's methods and qualitative analysis of field reports, media briefings, and political rhetoric, I find that the full presence of each of these independent variables accounts for civil war in the Libyan case. In the Syrian case, incomplete presence of the five independent variables has, for the moment, prevented full-fledged civil war. The research thus allows for a more complete understanding of what constitutes civil war and provides a framework for conflict analysis as Arab Spring movements develop.},

Morphogenesis can be viewed as a consequence, in part, of cell locomotion, from large-scale migrations of epithelial sheets during gastrulation, to the movement of individual cells during development of the nervous system. In an adult organism, cell migration is essential for proper immune response, wound repair, and tissue homeostasis, while aberrant cell migration is found in various pathologies. Indeed, as our knowledge of migration increases, we can look forward to, for example, abating the spread of highly malignant cancer cells, retarding the invasion of white cells in the inflammatory process, or enhancing the healing of wounds. This article is organized in two main sections. The first section is devoted to the single-cell migrating in isolation such as occurs when leukocytes migrate during the immune response or when fibroblasts squeeze through connective tissue. The second section is devoted to cells collectively migrating as part of multicellular clusters or sheets. This second type of migration is prevalent in development, wound healing, and in some forms of cancer metastasis. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physiological Society},

After a few iterations of the EMC update rule, the reconstructed intensity is given to the difference-map algorithm for reconstruction of the particle contrast. We demonstrate reconstructions with simulated data and investigate the effects of particle complexity, number of measurements, and the number of photons per measurement.

abstract = {Imaging of microbial interactions has so far been based on well-established electron microscopy methods. This study presents a new way to study bacterial colonies and interactions between bacteria and their viruses, bacteriophages (phages), in situ on agar plates using helium ion microscopy (HIM). In biological imaging, HIM has advantages over traditional scanning electron microscopy with its sub-nanometer resolution, increased surface sensitivity, and the possibility to image nonconductive samples. Furthermore, by controlling the He beam dose or by using heavier Ne ions, the HIM instrument provides the possibility to mill out material in the samples, allowing for subsurface imaging and in situ sectioning. Here, the first HIM-images of bacterial colonies and phage–bacterium interactions are presented at different stages of the infection as they occur on an agar culture. The feasibility of neon and helium milling is also demonstrated to reveal the subsurface structures of bacterial colonies on agar substrate, and in some cases also structure inside individual bacteria after cross-sectioning. The study concludes that HIM offers great opportunities to advance the studies of microbial imaging, in particular in the area of interaction of viruses with cells.},

abstract = {The assembly of actin filaments into distinct cytoskeletal structures plays a critical role in cell movement, shape change, and mechanics, but how different sets of proteins localize to these structures within a shared cytoplasm remains unclear. Here, we show that the actin-binding domains of accessory proteins can be sensitive to filament conformational changes induced by perturbations that include other binding proteins, stabilizing drugs, and physical constraints on the filament. Using a combination of live cell imaging and in vitro single molecule binding measurements, we demonstrate that the affinity of tandem calponin homology domain (CH1-CH2) mutants varies as actin filament twist is altered, and we show differential localization of native and mutant CH1-CH2 domains to actin networks at the front and rear of motile cells. These findings suggest that conformational heterogeneity of actin filaments in cells could influence the biochemical composition of cytoskeletal structures through a biophysical feedback loop.},

abstract = {Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are mononuclear cells that circulate in the blood and are derived from different tissues, expressing cell surface markers that are similar to mature endothelial cells. The discovery of EPCs has lead to new insights in vascular repair and atherosclerosis and also a new theory for ageing. EPCs from the bone marrow and some other organs aid in vascular repair by migrating to distant vessels where they differentiate into mature endothelial cells and replace old and injured endothelial cells. The ability of EPCs to repair vascular damage depends on their number and functionality. Currently marketed drugs used in a variety of diseases can modulate these characteristics. In this review, the effect of currently available treatment options for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders on EPC biology will be discussed. The various EPC-based therapies that will be discussed include lipid-lowering agents, antihypertensive agents, antidiabetic drugs, phosphodiesteraze inhibitors, hormones, as well as EPC capturing stents.},

abstract = {Overexpression is a notorious concern in conventional and especially in super-resolution fluorescence light microscopy studies because it may cause numerous artifacts including ectopic sub-cellular localizations, erroneous formation of protein complexes, and others. Nonetheless, current live cell super-resolution microscopy studies generally rely on the overexpression of a host protein fused to a fluorescent protein. Here, we establish CRISPR/Cas9-mediated generation of heterozygous and homozygous human knockin cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged proteins from their respective native genomic loci at close to endogenous levels. We tagged three different proteins, exhibiting various localizations and expression levels, with the reversibly switchable fluorescent protein rsEGFP2. We demonstrate the benefit of endogenous expression levels compared to overexpression and show that typical overexpression-induced artefacts were avoided in genome-edited cells. Fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis revealed a narrow distribution of fusion protein expression levels in genome-edited cells, compared to a pronounced variability in transiently transfected cells. Using low light intensity RESOLFT (reversible saturable optical fluorescence transitions) nanoscopy we show sub-diffraction resolution imaging of living human knockin cells. Our strategy to generate human cell lines expressing fluorescent fusion proteins at endogenous levels for RESOLFT nanoscopy can be extended to other fluorescent tags and super-resolution approaches.},

abstract = {The oligomers formed during the early steps of amyloid aggregation are thought to be responsible for the neurotoxic damage associated with Alzheimer's disease. It is therefore of great interest to characterize this early aggregation process and the aggregates formed, especially for the most significant peptide in amyloid fibrils, Amyloid-$\beta$(1-42) (A$\beta$42). For this purpose, we directly monitored the changes in size and concentration of initially monomeric A$\beta$42 samples, using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy. We found that A$\beta$42 undergoes aggregation only when the amount of amyloid monomers exceeds the critical aggregation concentration (cac) of about 90 nM. This spontaneous, cooperative process resembles surfactants self-Assembly and yields stable micellelike oligomers whose size (≈50 monomers, Rh ≈ 7-11 nm) and elongated shape are independent of incubation time and peptide concentration. These findings reveal essential features of in vitro amyloid aggregation, which may illuminate the complex in vivo process.},

This high sensitivity enables the accurate determination of the secondary structure of single protein molecules with over a million-fold lower mass than conventional bulk vibrational spectroscopy.

abstract = {Phage therapy is the clinical or veterinary application of bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) as antibacterial "drugs." More generally, phages can be used as biocontrol agents against plant as well as foodborne pathogens. In this chapter, we consider the therapeutic use of phage cocktails, which is the combining of two or more phage types to produce more pharmacologically diverse formulations. The primary motivation for the use of cocktails is their broader spectra of activity in comparison to individual phage isolates: they can impact either more bacterial types or achieve effectiveness under a greater diversity of conditions. The combining of phages can also facilitate better targeting of multiple strains making up individual bacterial species or covering multiple species that might be responsible for similar disease states, in general providing, relative to individual phage isolates, a greater potential for presumptive or empirical treatment. Contrasting the use of phage banks, or even phage isolation against specific etiologies that have been obtained directly from patients under treatment, here we consider the utility as well as potential shortcomings associated with the use of phage cocktails as therapeutic antibacterial agents. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Thus, BRCA2 is essential for efficient homology-directed repair, presumably in conjunction with the Rad51 recombinase.

abstract = {Microglia, the main phagocytes of the central nervous system (CNS), are involved in the surveillance and maintenance of nervous tissue. During normal tissue homeostasis, microglia migrates within the CNS, phagocytose dead cells and tissue debris, and modulate synapse pruning and spine formation via controlled phagocytosis. In the event of an invasion by a foreign body, microglia are able to phagocytose the invading pathogen and process it proteolytically for antigen presentation. Internalized substrates are incorporated and sorted within the endocytic pathway and thereafter transported via complex vesicular routes. When targeted for degradation, substrates are delivered to acidic late endosomes and lysosomes. In these, the enzymatic degradation relies on pH and enzyme content. Endocytosis, sorting, transport, compartment acidification and degradation are regulated by complex signaling mechanisms, and these may be altered during aging and pathology. In this review, we discuss the endocytic pathway in microglia, with insight into the mechanisms controlling lysosomal biogenesis and pH regulation. We also discuss microglial lysosome function associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the mechanisms of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) internalization and degradation. Finally, we explore some therapies currently being investigated to treat AD and their effects on microglial response to A$\beta$, with insight in those involving enhancement of lysosomal function.},

By overcoming this limitation via adaptations of stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, we directly measure the concentration profile of polymer solutions at a nonadsorbing wall under Poiseuille flow. Using this approach, we 1) confirm the theoretically predicted concentration profile governed by entropically driven depletion, 2) observe depletion layer narrowing at low to intermediate shear rates, and 3) report depletion layer composition that approaches pure solvent at unexpectedly low shear rates.},

The facility is now operating at X-ray wavelengths from 22 to 1.2 {\AA} and is presently delivering this high-brilliance beam to a growing array of scientific researchers.

abstract = {The significant research interest in the engineering of photovoltaic (PV) structures at the nanoscale is directed toward enabling reductions in PV module fabrication and installation costs as well as improving cell power conversion efficiency (PCE). With the emergence of a multitude of nanostructured photovoltaic (nano-PV) device architectures, the question has arisen of where both the practical and the fundamental limits of performance reside in these new systems. Here, the former is addressed a posteriori. The specific challenges associated with improving the electrical power conversion efficiency of various nano-PV technologies are discussed and several approaches to reduce their thermal losses beyond the single bandgap limit are reviewed. Critical considerations related to the module lifetime and cost that are unique to nano-PV architectures are also addressed. The analysis suggests that a practical single-junction laboratory power conversion efficiency limit of 17{\%} and a two-cell tandem power conversion efficiency limit of 24{\%} are possible for nano-PVs, which, when combined with operating lifetimes of 10 to 15 years, could position them as a transformational technology for solar energy markets.},

Here we present a colocalization methodology that combines scattering interferometry and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to visualize both position and orientation of single quantum dot-labeled Simian virus 40 (SV40) particles. By achieving nanometer spatial and 8 ms temporal resolution, we observed sliding and tumbling motions during rapid lateral diffusion on supported lipid bilayers, and repeated back and forth rocking between nanoscopic regions separated by 9 nm. Our findings suggest recurrent swap of receptors and viral pentamers as well as receptor aggregation in nanodomains. We discuss the prospects of our technique for studying virus-membrane interactions and for resolving nanoscopic dynamics of individual biological nano-objects.},

abstract = {Viral infection begins with the binding of a virus to a specific target on the surface of the host cell, followed by viral genome delivery into the host and a continuation of the infection process. Before binding occurs, the virus must first find its receptor by a process whose details are largely unknown. We applied high-resolution fluorescence microscopy and single-particle tracking to elucidate the target-finding process in bacteriophage $\lambda$ as it infects an Escherichia coli cell. By monitoring the motion of individual viruses through the early stages of infection, we identified a unique spatial focusing process that allows a virus to arrive from its initial random landing site to its destination at the cell pole. The search process is governed by the interaction between the virus and the LamB receptors, and by the spatial organization of the receptor network on the cell surface. Our findings allowed us to develop a theoretical model for the target-finding process that reproduces the key features observed in experiment. We discuss the possible implications of our findings for the process of viral receptor-finding in higher systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

Whereas microclusters have been studied extensively using confocal microscopy, the spatial and kinetic relationships of their signaling components have not been well characterized due to limits in image resolution and acquisition speed. Here we show, using TIRF-SIM to examine the organization of microclusters at sub-diffraction resolution, the presence of two spatially distinct domains composed of ZAP70-bound TCR and LAT-associated signaling complex. Kinetic analysis of microcluster assembly reveal surprising delays between the stepwise recruitment of ZAP70 and signaling proteins to the TCR, as well as distinct patterns in their disassociation. These delays are regulated by intracellular calcium flux downstream of T cell activation. Our results reveal novel insights into the spatial and kinetic regulation of TCR microcluster formation and T cell activation.},

The most reactive phase would clearly be that phase upon which the impinging CO and O2 molecules achieve a reaction probability of unity or near unity. The classical molecular beam work by Ertl and co-workers1-3 has demon- strated that under optimum conditions, a reaction probability of near-unity is obtainable on metallic Pt and Pd surfaces. In contrast, a reaction probability even remotely close to the CO/ O2 collision limit has never been achieved on any oxidized phase.2,4-6 These results in themselves constitute a self-proof that an oxide phase is much less reactive than a metallic phase.},

abstract = {In this minireview we have attempted to provide some overall perspective on the question of how various forms of diffusion in reduced dimensions, or diffusion within a nonspecifically bound state, can speed biological interactions beyond the limits normally set by three-dimensional diffusion processes. To this end we began by discussing the rates expected for small molecules engaged in classical elastic collisions. We then proceeded to modify this picture by introducing first the features of inelastic macromolecular collisions in solution, then the effects of specific electrostatic fields set up around macromolecules of known structure at low ionic strengths, and finally the special rate enhancements available to DNA-protein interactions because of the particular geometry of the DNA molecule and the multiple conformations that can be assumed by the protein component. We hope that this exposition will help to clarify the subject for others and also will stimulate more focused examination of this type of problem, both in DNA-protein interaction systems and in other biological systems where such rate facilitation might apply.},

abstract = {A sensitive membrane filter assay for the lac repressor-operator complex has been used to study the kinetics of repressor and operator interaction. The rate of dissociation of the complex is very slow and follows first-order kinetics with a half-life of 19 minutes in our standard buffer (0.05 m ionic strength). The rate of dissociation (kb) is rather insensitive to temperature or pH, but becomes more rapid at high ionic strength. In 0.2 m ionic strength buffer the dissociation half-life is five to six minutes. The rate of association of repressor and operator is very fast and follows second-order kinetics with the rate constant for association (ka) being 7 × 109m-1sec-1in our standard buffer. The rate of association is only slightly affected by temperature or pH, but becomes slower with increasing ionic strength. It is concluded that the association of repressor and operator is aided by electrostatic attraction between the phosphate groups of DNA and a positively charged binding site on the lac repressor. Over a wide range of ionic strength, the ratio kbkahas been found to agree well with the equilibrium constant. The binding of repressor to operator results in an unfavorable enthalpy change; the driving force for the binding reaction comes from a large entropy increase. Binding mechanisms are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1969.},

Much of our knowledge about decision-making is derived from simple models, such as bacteriophage lambda infection, in which lambda chooses between the vegetative lytic fate and the dormant lysogenic fate. This paradigmatic system is broadly understood but lacking mechanistic details, partly due to limited resolution of past studies. Here, we discuss how modern technologies have enabled high-resolution examination of lambda decision-making to provide new insights and exciting possibilities in studying this classical system. The advent of techniques for labeling specific DNA, RNA, and proteins in cells allows for molecular-level characterization of events in lambda development. These capabilities yield both new answers and new questions regarding how the isolated lambda genetic circuit acts, what biological events transpire among phages in their natural context, and how the synergy of simple phage macromolecules brings about complex behaviors.},

abstract = {Fluorescence anisotropy and linear dichroism imaging have been widely used for imaging biomolecular orienta- tional distributions in protein aggregates, fibrillar structures of cells, and cell membranes. However, these techniques do not give access to complete orientational order information in a whole image, because their use is limited to parts of the sample where the average orientation of molecules is known a priori. Fluorescence anisotropy is also highly sensitive to depolarization mecha- nisms such as those induced by fluorescence energy transfer. A fully excitation-polarization-resolved fluorescence microscopy imaging that relies on the use of a tunable incident polarization and a nonpolarized detection is able to circumvent these limita- tions. We have developed such a technique in confocal epifluorescence microscopy, giving access to new regions of study in the complex and heterogeneous molecular organization of cell membranes. Using this technique, we demonstrate morphological changes at the subdiffraction scale in labeled COS-7 cell membranes whose cytoskeleton is perturbed. Molecular orientational order is also seen to be affected by cholesterol depletion, reflecting the strong interplay between lipid-packing regions and their nearby cytoskeleton. This noninvasive optical technique can reveal local organization in cell membranes when used as a complement to existing methods such as generalized polarization.},

Here, we have analysed and compared the structures of the filaments formed by dGAE in vitro with those deposited in the brains of individuals diagnosed with AD. We show that dGAE forms PHFs that share a macromolecular structure similar to those found in brain tissue.

abstract = {Perovskite solar cells based on organometal halides represent an emerging photovoltaic technology. Perovskite solar cells stem from dye-sensitized solar cells. In a liquid-based dye-sensitized solar cell structure, the adsorption of methylammonium lead halide perovskite on a nanocrystalline TiO 2 surface produces a photocurrent with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 3-4{\%}, as first discovered in 2009. The PCE was doubled after 2 years by optimizing the perovskite coating conditions. However, the liquid-based perovskite solar cell receives little attention because of its stability issues, including instant dissolution of the perovskite in a liquid electrolyte. A long-term, stable, and high efficiency (∼10{\%}) perovskite solar cell was developed in 2012 by substituting the solid hole conductor with a liquid electrolyte. Efficiencies have quickly risen to 18{\%} in just 2 years. Since PCE values over 20{\%} are realistically anticipated with the use of cheap organometal halide perovskite materials, perovskite solar cells are a promising photovoltaic technology. In this review, the opto-electronic properties of perovskite materials and recent progresses in perovskite solar cells are described. In addition, comments on the issues to current and future challenges are mentioned.},

abstract = {The number of macromolecular structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank now approaches 100 000, with the vast majority of them determined by crystallographic methods. Thousands of papers describing such structures have been published in the scientific literature, and 20 Nobel Prizes in chemistry or medicine have been awarded for discoveries based on macromolecular crystallography. New hardware and software tools have made crystallography appear to be an almost routine (but still far from being analytical) technique and many structures are now being determined by scientists with very limited experience in the practical aspects of the field. However, this apparent ease is sometimes illusory and proper procedures need to be followed to maintain high standards of structure quality. In addition, many noncrystallographers may have problems with the critical evaluation and interpretation of structural results published in the scientific literature. The present review provides an outline of the technical aspects of crystallography for less experienced practitioners, as well as information that might be useful for users of macromolecular structures, aiming to show them how to interpret (but not overinterpret) the information present in the coordinate files and in their description. A discussion of the extent of information that can be gleaned from the atomic coordinates of structures solved at different resolution is provided, as well as problems and pitfalls encountered in structure determination and interpretation. This review, addressed to the less experienced macromolecular crystallographers and to users of biological structures, provides an outline of the technical aspects of crystallography, and discusses common problems and pitfalls encountered during structure determination and interpretation. It includes tips on how to interpret, but not overinterpret, the information present in the coordinate files and in their description. {\textcopyright} 2013 FEBS.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are highly polymorphic structures formed by many different proteins. They provide biological function but also abnormally accumulate in numerous human diseases. The physicochemical principles of amyloid polymorphism are not understood due to lack of structural insights at the single-fibril level. To identify and classify different fibril polymorphs and to quantify the level of heterogeneity is essential to decipher the precise links between amyloid structures and their functional and disease associated properties such as toxicity, strains, propagation and spreading. Employing gentle, force-distance curve-based AFM, we produce detailed images, from which the 3D reconstruction of individual filaments in heterogeneous amyloid samples is achieved. Distinctive fibril polymorphs are then classified by hierarchical clustering, and sample heterogeneity is objectively quantified. These data demonstrate the polymorphic nature of fibril populations, provide important information regarding the energy landscape of amyloid self-assembly, and offer quantitative insights into the structural basis of polymorphism in amyloid populations.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has become established as a diagnostic and research tool in many areas of medicine because of its ability to provide excellent soft-tissue delineation in different areas of interest. In addition to T1- and T2-weighted imaging, many specialized MR techniques have been designed to extract metabolic or biophysical information. Diffusion-weighted imaging gives insight into the movement of water molecules in tissue, and diffusion-tensor imaging can reveal fiber orientation in the white matter tracts. Metabolic information about the object of interest can be obtained with spectroscopy of protons, in addition to imaging of other nuclei, such as sodium. Dynamic contrast material-enhanced imaging and recently proton spectroscopy play an important role in oncologic imaging. When these techniques are combined, they can assist the physician in making a diagnosis or monitoring a treatment regimen. One of the major advantages of the different types of MR imaging is the ability of the operator to manipulate image contrast with a variety of selectable parameters that affect the kind and quality of the information provided. The elements used to obtain MR images and the factors that affect formation of an MR image include MR instrumentation, localization of the MR signal, gradients, k-space, and pulse sequences.},

abstract = {Forensic science is an important field of analytical chemistry where vibrational spectroscopy, in particular Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, present advantages as they have a nondestructive nature, high selectivity, and no need for sample preparation. Herein, we demonstrate a method for determination of donor sex, based on attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectroscopy of dry urine traces. Trace body fluid evidence is of special importance to the modern criminal investigation as a source of individualizing DNA evidence. However, individual identification of a urine donor is generally difficult because of the small amount of DNA. Therefore, the development of an innovative method to provide phenotype information about the urine donor - including sex - is highly desirable. In this study, we developed a multivariate discriminant model for the ATR FT-IR spectra of dry urine to identify the donor sex. Rigorous selection of significant wavenumbers on the spectrum using a genetic algorithm enabled superb discrimination performance for the model and conclusively indicated a chemical origin for donor sex differences, which was supported by physiological knowledge. Although further investigations need to be conducted, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates the great potential of the developed methodology for phenotype profiling based on the analysis of urine traces.},

abstract = {Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a lethal disease characterized by the deposition of the immunoglobulin light chain into amyloid fibrils, resulting in organ dysfunction and failure. Amyloid fibrils have the ability to self-propagate, recruiting soluble protein into the fibril by a nucleation-polymerization mechanism, characteristic of autocatalytic reactions. Experimental data suggest the existence of a critical concentration for initiation of fibril formation. As such, the initial concentration of soluble amyloidogenic protein is expected to have a profound effect on the rate of fibril formation. In this work, we present in vitro evidence that fibril formation rates for AL light chains are affected by the protein concentration in a differential manner. De novo reactions of the proteins with the fastest amyloid kinetics (AL-09, AL-T05, and AL-103) do not present protein concentration dependence. Seeded reactions, however, exhibited weak protein concentration dependence. For AL-12, seeded and protein concentration dependence data suggest a synergistic effect for recruitment and elongation at low protein concentrations, while reactions of $\kappa$I exhibited poor efficiency in nucleating and elongating preformed fibrils. Additionally, co-aggregation and cross seeding of $\kappa$I variable domain (VL) and the $\kappa$I full length (FL) light chain indicate that the presence of the constant domain in $\kappa$I FL modulates fibril formation, facilitating the recruitment of $\kappa$I VL. Together, these results indicate that the dominant process in fibril formation varies among the AL proteins tested with a differential dependence of the protein concentration.},

Like CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a has been harnessed for genome editing on the basis of its ability to generate targeted, double-stranded DNA breaks. Here we show that RNA-guided DNA binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity by Cas12a that completely degrades ssDNA molecules. We find that target-activated, nonspecific single-stranded deoxyribonuclease (ssDNase) cleavage is also a property of other type V CRISPR-Cas12 enzymes. By combining Cas12a ssDNase activation with isothermal amplification, we create a method termed DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR), which achieves attomolar sensitivity for DNA detection. DETECTR enables rapid and specific detection of human papillomavirus in patient samples, thereby providing a simple platform for molecular diagnostics.},

abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with inflammation. AF patients have elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines known to promote vascular leak, such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF). However, the contribution of vascular leak and consequent cardiac edema to the genesis of atrial arrhythmias remains unknown. Previous work suggests that interstitial edema in the heart can acutely promote ventricular arrhythmias by disrupting ventricular myocyte intercalated disk (ID) nanodomains rich in cardiac sodium channels (NaV1.5) and slowing cardiac conduction. Interestingly, similar disruption of ID nanodomains has been identified in atrial samples from AF patients. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that VEGF-induced vascular leak can acutely increase atrial arrhythmia susceptibility by disrupting ID nanodomains and slowing atrial conduction. Treatment of murine hearts with VEGF (30–60 min, at clinically relevant levels) prolonged the electrocardiographic P wave and increased susceptibility to burst pacing-induced atrial arrhythmias. Optical voltage mapping revealed slower atrial conduction following VEGF treatment (10 ± 0.4 cm/s vs. 21 ± 1 cm/s at baseline, p {\textless} 0.05). Transmission electron microscopy revealed increased intermembrane spacing at ID sites adjacent to gap junctions (GJs; 64 ± 9 nm versus 17 ± 1 nm in controls, p {\textless} 0.05), as well as sites next to mechanical junctions (MJs; 63 ± 4 nm versus 27 ± 2 nm in controls, p {\textless} 0.05) in VEGF–treated hearts relative to controls. Importantly, super-resolution microscopy and quantitative image analysis revealed reorganization of NaV1.5 away from dense clusters localized near GJs and MJs to a more diffuse distribution throughout the ID. Taken together, these data suggest that VEGF can acutely predispose otherwise normal hearts to atrial arrhythmias by dynamically disrupting NaV1.5-rich ID nanodomains and slowing atrial conduction. These data highlight inflammation-induced vascular leak as a potential factor in the development and progression of AF.},

abstract = {Indole has many, diverse roles in bacterial signaling. It regulates the transition from exponential to stationary phase, it is involved in the control of plasmid stability, and it influences biofilm formation, virulence, and stress responses (including antibiotic resistance). Its role is not restricted to bacteria, and recently it has been shown to include mutually beneficial signaling between enteric bacteria and their mammalian hosts. In many respects indole behaves like the signaling component of a quorum-sensing system. Indole synthesized within the producer bacterium is exported into the surroundings where its accumulation is detected by sensitive cells. A view often repeated in the literature is that in Escherichia coli the AcrEF-TolC and Mtr transporter proteins are involved in the export and import, respectively, of indole. However, the evidence for their involvement is indirect, and it has been known for a long time that indole can pass directly through a lipid bilayer. We have combined in vivo and in vitro approaches to examine the relative importance of protein-mediated transport and direct passage across the E. coli membrane. We conclude that the movement of indole across the E. coli membrane under normal physiological conditions is independent of AcrEF-TolC and Mtr. Furthermore, direct observation of individual liposomes shows that indole can rapidly cross an E. coli lipid membrane without the aid of any proteinaceous transporter. These observations not only enhance our understanding of indole signaling in bacteria but also provide a simple explanation for the ability of indole to signal between biological kingdoms.},

abstract = {Using optical tweezers and single particle tracking, we have revealed the motion of a single protein, the $\lambda$-receptor, in the outer membrane of living Escherichia col/bacteria. We genetically modified the $\lambda$-receptor placing a biotin on an extracellular site of the receptor in vivo. The efficiency of this in vivo biotinylation is very low, thus enabling the attachment of a streptavidin-coated bead binding specifically to a single biotinylated $\lambda$-receptor. The bead was used as a handle for the optical tweezers and as a marker for the single particle tracking routine. We propose a model that allows extraction of the motion of the protein from measurements of the mobility of the bead-molecule complex; these results are equally applicable to analyze bead-protein complexes in other membrane systems. Within a domain of radius ≃25 nm, the receptor diffuses with a diffusion constant of (1.5 ± 1.0) x 10-9 cm2/s and sits in a harmonic potential as if it were tethered by an elastic spring of spring constant of ∼1.0 x 10-2 pN/nm to the bacterial membrane.

abstract = {Statistical fluctuations limit the precision with which a microorganism can, in a given time T, determine the concentration of a chemoattractant in the surrounding medium. The best a cell can do is to monitor continually the state of occupation of receptors distributed over its surface. For nearly optimum performance only a small fraction of the surface need be specifically adsorbing. The probability that a molecule that has collided with the cell will find a receptor is Ns/(Ns + pi a), if N receptors, each with a binding site of radius s, are evenly distributed over a cell of radius a. There is ample room for many indenpendent systems of specific receptors. The adsorption rate for molecules of moderate size cannot be significantly enhanced by motion of the cell or by stirring of the medium by the cell. The least fractional error attainable in the determination of a concentration c is approximately (TcaD) - 1/2, where D is diffusion constant of the attractant. The number of specific receptors needed to attain such precision is about a/s. Data on bacteriophage absorption, bacterial chemotaxis, and chemotaxis in a cellular slime mold are evaluated. The chemotactic sensitivity of Escherichia coli approaches that of the cell of optimum design. {\textcopyright} 1977, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The evaluation of cytoskeletal bundling is a fundamental experimental method in the field of cell biology. Although the skewness of the pixel intensity distribution derived from fluorescently-labeled cytoskeletons has been widely used as a metric to evaluate the degree of bundling in digital microscopy images, its versatility has not been fully validated. Here, we applied the coefficient of variation (CV) of intensity values as an alternative metric, and compared its performance with skewness. In synthetic images representing extremely bundled conditions, the CV successfully detected degrees of bundling that could not be distinguished by skewness. On actual microscopy images, CV was better than skewness, especially on variable-angle epifluorescence microscopic images or stimulated emission depletion and confocal microscopy images of very small areas of around 1 $\mu$m2. When blur or noise was added to synthetic images, CV was found to be robust to blur but deleteriously affected by noise, whereas skewness was robust to noise but deleteriously affected by blur. For confocal images, CV and skewness showed similar sensitivity to noise, possibly because optical blurring is often present in microscopy images. Therefore, in practical use with actual microscopy images, CV may be more appropriate than skewness, unless the image is extremely noisy.},

Skewness is commonly used to find the degree of bundling of the cytoskeleton, but CV is actually more robust to blurring (although it doesn't do very well with high noise).},

abstract = {In the developing cortex, projection neurons undergo multipolar-bipolar transition, radial-directed migration, and maturation. The contribution of these developmental steps to the structure of the adult cortex is not completely understood. Here, we report that huntingtin (HTT), the protein mutated in Huntington's disease, is enriched in polarizing projection neurons. The depletion of HTT in postmitotic projection neurons leads to the mislocalization of layer-specific neuronal populations in the mouse neocortex. HTT is required for the multipolar-bipolar transition of projection neurons and for the maintenance of their bipolar shape during their radial migration. HTT mediates these effects in vivo through the regulation of RAB11-dependent N-Cadherin trafficking. Importantly, HD pathological HTT alters RAB11-dependent neuronal migration. Finally, we show that the cortical defects resulting from the postmitotic loss of HTT specifically during embryonic development affect neuronal morphology at adulthood. Our data reveal a new HTT-RAB11-N-Cadherin pathway regulating multipolar-bipolar transition with direct implications for mature brain. Video Abstract},

abstract = {The $\alpha$$\beta$ T-cell coreceptor CD4 enhances immune responses more than 1 million-fold in some assays, and yet the affinity of CD4 for its ligand, peptide-major histocompatibility class II (pMHC II) on antigen-presenting cells, is so weak that it was previously unquantifiable. Here, we report that a soluble form of CD4 failed to bind detectably to pMHC II in surface plasmon resonance-based assays, establishing a new upper limit for the solution affinity at 2.5 mM. However, when presented multivalently on magnetic beads, soluble CD4 bound pMHC II-expressing B cells, confirming that it is active and allowing mapping of the native coreceptor binding site on pMHC II. Whereas binding was undetectable in solution, the affinity of the CD4/pMHC II interaction could be measured in 2D using CD4- and adhesion molecule-functionalized, supported lipid bilayers, yielding a 2D Kd of ∼5,000 molecules/$\mu$m2. This value is two to three orders of magnitude higher than previously measured 2D Kd values for interacting leukocyte surface proteins. Calculations indicated, however, that CD4/pMHC II binding would increase rates of T-cell receptor (TCR) complex phosphorylation by threefold via the recruitment of Lck, with only a small, 2-20{\%} increase in the effective affinity of the TCR for pMHC II. The affinity of CD4/pMHC II therefore seems to be set at a value that increases T-cell sensitivity by enhancing phosphorylation, without compromising ligand discrimination.},

abstract = {Typically, models of bacteriophage adsorption consider the process in two steps: reversible and irreversible attachment. In this study, a recently introduced one-step adsorption model, the adsorption efficiency model, is used to describe the adsorption of T-series bacteriophages to Escherichia coli. The adsorption efficiency model simplifies phage attachment to a single step: irreversible binding. The adsorption efficiency (e{\{}open{\}}) is used to account for unadsorbed phages. The model accurately describes T-series phage adsorption (T2, T4, T5, T6, and T7) under a variety of conditions. In addition, the model is compared to a commonly used two-step adsorption model, the sequential model. Experimental data support the assumptions of the adsorption efficiency model and suggest that the reversible first step of T-series phage adsorption is equivalent to irreversible attachment under the conditions tested. The adsorption efficiency model was not appropriate for a phage $\lambda$ strain lacking side tail fibers. However, the model did agree with data previously published for a strain of phage $\lambda$ possessing side tail fibers, as is the case of all T-series strains tested. This suggests that the adsorption efficiency model applies to phages containing side tail fibers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The importance of characterizing their aggregation has steadily increased because of their link to human diseases and material science applications. In particular, misfolding and aggregation of the Josephin domain of ataxin-3 is implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia-3. Infrared nanospectroscopy, simultaneously exploiting atomic force microscopy and infrared spectroscopy, can characterize at the nanoscale the conformational rearrangements of proteins during their aggregation. Here we demonstrate that we can individually characterize the oligomeric and fibrillar species formed along the amyloid aggregation. We describe their secondary structure, monitoring at the nanoscale an $\alpha$-to-$\beta$ transition, and couple these studies with an independent measurement of the evolution of their intrinsic stiffness. These results suggest that the aggregation of Josephin proceeds from the monomer state to the formation of spheroidal intermediates with a native structure. Only successively, these intermediates evolve into misfolded aggregates and into the final fibrils.},

abstract = {Understanding the complexity of the cellular environment will benefit from the ability to unambiguously resolve multiple cellular components, simultaneously and with nanometer-scale spatial resolution. Multicolor super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques have been developed to achieve this goal, yet challenges remain in terms of the number of targets that can be simultaneously imaged and the crosstalk between color channels. Herein, we demonstrate multicolor stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) based on a multi-parameter detection strategy, which uses both the fluorescence activation wavelength and the emission color to discriminate between photo-activatable fluorescent probes. First, we obtained two-color super-resolution images using the near-infrared cyanine dye Alexa 750 in conjunction with a red cyanine dye Alexa 647, and quantified color crosstalk levels and image registration accuracy. Combinatorial pairing of these two switchable dyes with fluorophores which enhance photo-activation enabled multi-parameter detection of six different probes. Using this approach, we obtained six-color super-resolution fluorescence images of a model sample. The combination of multiple fluorescence detection parameters for improved fluorophore discrimination promises to substantially enhance our ability to visualize multiple cellular targets with sub-diffraction-limit resolution.

The isothermal RPA was applied to amplify specific target sequences from the pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using genomic DNA. Additionally, a positive plasmid control was established as an internal control. The four targets were amplified simultaneously in a quadruplex reaction. The amplicon is labeled during on-chip RPA by reverse oligonucleotide primers coupled to a fluorophore. Both amplification and spatially resolved signal generation take place on immobilized forward primers bount to expoxy-silanized glass surfaces in a pump-driven hybridization chamber. The combination of microarray technology and sensitive isothermal nucleic acid amplification at 38 °C allows for a multiparameter analysis on a rather small area. The on-chip RPA was characterized in terms of reaction time, sensitivity and inhibitory conditions. A successful enzymatic reaction is completed in {\textless}20 min and results in detection limits of 10 colony-forming units for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica and 100 colony-forming units for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

LATE-PCR also introduces new probe design criteria that uncouple hybridization probe detection from primer annealing and extension, increase probe reliability, improve allele discrimination, and increase signal strength by 80-250{\%} relative to symmetric PCR. These improvements in PCR are particularly useful for real-time quantitative analysis of target numbers in small samples. LATE-PCR is adaptable to high throughput applications in fields such as clinical diagnostics, biodefense, forensics, and DNA sequencing.

abstract = {Infrared (IR; or mid-infrared, MIR; 4000-400 cm−1; 2500–25,000 nm) spectroscopy has become one of the most powerful and versatile tools at the disposal of modern bioscience. Because of its high molecular specificity, applicability to wide variety of samples, rapid measurement and non-invasivity, IR spectroscopy forms a potent approach to elucidate qualitative and quantitative information from various kinds of biological material. For these reasons, it became an established bioanalytical technique with diverse applications. This work aims to be a comprehensive and critical review of the recent accomplishments in the field of biomolecular and bioanalytical IR spectroscopy. That progress is presented on a wider background, with fundamental characteristics, the basic principles of the technique outlined, and its scientific capability directly compared with other methods being used in similar fields (e.g. near-infrared, Raman, fluorescence). The article aims to present a complete examination of the topic, as it touches the background phenomena, instrumentation, spectra processing and data analytical methods, spectra interpretation and related information. To suit this goal, the article includes a tutorial information essential to obtain a thorough perspective of bio-related applications of the reviewed methodologies. The importance of the fundamental factors to the final performance and applicability of IR spectroscopy in various areas of bioscience is explained. This information is interpreted in critical way, with aim to gain deep understanding why IR spectroscopy finds extraordinarily intensive use in this remarkably diverse and dynamic field of research and utility. The major focus is placed on the diversity of the applications in which IR biospectroscopy has been established so far and those onto which it is expanding nowadays. This includes qualitative and quantitative analytical spectroscopy, spectral imaging, medical diagnosis, monitoring of biophysical processes, and studies of physicochemical properties and dynamics of biomolecules. The application potential of IR spectroscopy in light of the current accomplishments and the future prospects is critically evaluated and its significance in the progress of bioscience is comprehensively presented.},

abstract = {The first stages of productive bacteriophage infections of bacterial host cells require efficient adsorption to the cell surface followed by ejection of phage DNA into the host cytoplasm. To achieve this goal, a phage virion must undergo significant structural remodeling. For phage T4, the most obvious change is the contraction of its tail. Here, we use skinny E. coli minicells as a host, along with cryo-electron tomography and mutant phage virions, to visualize key structural intermediates during initiation of T4 infection. We show for the first time that most long tail fibers are folded back against the tail sheath until irreversible adsorption, a feature compatible with the virion randomly walking across the cell surface to find an optimal site for infection. Our data confirm that tail contraction is triggered by structural changes in the baseplate, as intermediates were found with remodeled baseplates and extended tails. After contraction, the tail tube penetrates the host cell periplasm, pausing while it degrades the peptidoglycan layer. Penetration into the host cytoplasm is accompanied by a dramatic local outward curvature of the cytoplasmic membrane as it fuses with the phage tail tip. The baseplate hub protein gp27 and/or the ejected tape measure protein gp29 likely form the transmembrane channel for viral DNA passage into the cell cytoplasm. Building on the wealth of prior biochemical and structural information, this work provides new molecular insights into the mechanistic pathway of T4 phage infection.},

abstract = {Self-assembly of proteins and peptides into amyloid structures has been the subject of intense and focused research due to their association with neurodegenerative, age-related human diseases and transmissible prion diseases in humans and mammals. Of the disease associated amyloid assemblies, a diverse array of species, ranging from small oligomeric assembly intermediates to fibrillar structures, have been shown to have toxic potential. Equally, a range of species formed by the same disease associated amyloid sequences have been found to be relatively benign under comparable monomer equivalent concentrations and conditions. In recent years, an increasing number of functional amyloid systems have also been found. These developments show that not all amyloid structures are generically toxic to cells. Given these observations, it is important to understand why amyloid structures may encode such varied toxic potential despite sharing a common core molecular architecture. Here, we discuss possible links between different aspects of amyloidogenic structures and assembly mechanisms with their varied functional effects. We propose testable hypotheses for the relationship between amyloid structure and its toxic potential in the context of recent reports on amyloid sequence, structure, and toxicity relationships.},

abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most dangerous type of DNA damage because they can result in the loss of large chromosomal regions. In all mammalian cells, DSBs that occur throughout the cell cycle are repaired predominantly by the non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Defects in NHEJ result in sensitivity to ionizing radiation and the ablation of lymphocytes. The NHEJ pathway utilizes proteins that recognize, resect, polymerize and ligate the DNA ends in a flexible manner. This flexibility permits NHEJ to function on a wide range of DNA-end configurations, with the resulting repaired DNA junctions often containing mutations. In this Review, we discuss the most recent findings regarding the relative involvement of the different NHEJ proteins in the repair of various DNA-end configurations. We also discuss the shunting of DNA-end repair to the auxiliary pathways of alternative end joining (a-EJ) or single-strand annealing (SSA) and the relevance of these different pathways to human disease.},

abstract = {A key part of any super-resolution technique involves accurately correcting for mechanical motion of the sample and setup during acquisition. If left uncorrected, drift degrades the resolution of the final reconstructed image and can introduce unwanted artifacts. Here, we describe how to implement active stabilization, thereby reducing drift to {\~{}}1 nm across all three dimensions. In this protocol, we show how to implement our method on custom and standard microscopy hardware. We detail the construction of a separate illumination and detection path, dedicated exclusively to acquiring the diffraction pattern of fiducials deposited on the imaging slide. We also show how to focus lock and adjust the focus in arbitrary nanometer step size increments. Our real-time focus locking is based on kHz calculations performed using the graphics processing unit. The fast calculations allow for rapid repositioning of the sample, which reduces drift below the photon-limited localization precision. Our approach allows for a single-molecule and/or super-resolution image acquisition free from movement artifacts and eliminates the need for complex algorithms or hardware installations. The method is also useful for long acquisitions which span over hours or days, such as multicolor super resolution. Installation does not require specialist knowledge and can be implemented in standard biological laboratories. The full protocol can be implemented within {\~{}}2 weeks.},

abstract = {Essential cellular functions as diverse as genome maintenance and tissue morphogenesis rely on the dynamic organization of filamentous assemblies. For example, the precise structural organization of DNA filaments has profound consequences on all DNA-mediated processes including gene expression, whereas control over the precise spatial arrangement of cytoskeletal protein filaments is key for mechanical force generation driving animal tissue morphogenesis. Polarized fluorescence is currently used to extract structural organization of fluorescently labeled biological filaments by determining the orientation of fluorescent labels, however with a strong drawback: polarized fluorescence imaging is indeed spatially limited by optical diffraction, and is thus unable to discriminate between the intrinsic orientationalmobility of the fluorophore labels and the real structural disorder of the labeled biomolecules. Here, we demonstrate that quantitative single-molecule polarized detection in biological filament assemblies allows not only to correct for the rotational flexibility of the label but also to image orientational order of filaments at the nanoscale using superresolution capabilities. The method is based on polarized direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, using dedicated optical scheme and image analysis to determine both molecular localization and orientation with high precision. We apply this method to double-stranded DNA in vitro and microtubules and actin stress fibers in whole cells.},

These organelles play key biological roles, by compartmentalizing the cell to enable spatiotemporal control of biological reactions. Recent studies suggest that membrane-less intracellular compartments are multicomponent viscous liquid droplets that form via phase separation. Proteins that have an intrinsic tendency for being conformationally heterogeneous seem to be the main drivers of liquid-liquid phase separation in the cell. These findings highlight the relevance of classical concepts from the physics of polymeric phase transitions for understanding the assembly of intracellular membrane-less compartments. However, applying these concepts is challenging, given the heteropolymeric nature of protein sequences, the complex intracellular environment, and non-equilibrium features intrinsic to cells. This provides new opportunities for adapting established theories and for the emergence of new physics.},

abstract = {Atomic force microscopy, AFM, is a powerful tool that can produce detailed topographical images of individual nano-structures with a high signal-to-noise ratio without the need for ensemble averaging. However, the application of AFM in structural biology has been hampered by the tip-sample convolution effect, which distorts images of nano-structures, particularly those that are of similar dimensions to the cantilever probe tips used in AFM. Here we show that the tip-sample convolution results in a feature-dependent and non-uniform distribution of image resolution on AFM topographs. We show how this effect can be utilised in structural studies of nano-sized upward convex objects such as spherical or filamentous molecular assemblies deposited on a flat surface, because it causes 'magnification' of such objects in AFM topographs. Subsequently, this enhancement effect is harnessed through contact-point based deconvolution of AFM topographs. Here, the application of this approach is demonstrated through the 3D reconstruction of the surface envelope of individual helical amyloid filaments without the need of cross-particle averaging using the contact-deconvoluted AFM topographs. Resolving the structural variations of individual macromolecular assemblies within inherently heterogeneous populations is paramount for mechanistic understanding of many biological phenomena such as amyloid toxicity and prion strains. The approach presented here will also facilitate the use of AFM for high-resolution structural studies and integrative structural biology analysis of single molecular assemblies.},

The adsorption efficiency is the fraction of phage that adsorbs irreversibly to the host. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using the adsorption rate constant (k) and the adsorption efficiency ($\epsilon$). Experimental data demonstrated that the adsorption rate constant depends strongly on the condition of the host while the adsorption efficiency is a property of the bacteriophage population. The adsorption efficiency exhibited a marked dependence on the concentration of l-tryptophan. The system was used to study the effect of adsorption kinetics on bacteriophage amplification. Increasing adsorption efficiency had an effect similar to increasing the initial multiplicity of infection; the number of phages produced during amplification decreased. Optimizing the adsorption efficiency by manipulating the l-tryptophan concentration yielded a 14-fold increase in the number of phages produced.},

abstract = {Learning the basic concepts required to understand magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a straightforward process. Although the individual concepts are simple, there are many concepts to learn and retain simultaneously; this situation may give the illusion that learning the physics of MR imaging is complicated. It is important for the radiologist who interprets MR images to understand the methods used to create the images because image contrast specifically depends on how the image data were acquired. Initial concepts include formation of magnetic fields from electric currents in loops of wire, the resonance phenomenon, the hydrogen proton and its frequency of precession, and absorption of radiofrequency energy. These concepts can then be applied to learn about T1 and T2 relaxation and contrast and how the acquisition parameters of echo time and repetition time can be used to achieve these image contrasts. Basic pulse sequences include the spin-echo, multiecho spin-echo, turbo spin-echo, inversion-recovery, and gradient-recalled-echo sequences.},

Organic and inorganic hybrid perovskites ( e.g. , CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ), with advantages of facile processing, tunable bandgaps, and superior charge-transfer properties, have emerged as a new class of revolutionary optoelectronic semiconductors promising for various applications. Perovskite solar cells constructed with a variety of configurations have demonstrated unprecedented progress in efficiency, reaching about 20{\%} from multiple groups after only several years of active research. A key to this success is the development of various solution-synthesis and film-deposition techniques for controlling the morphology and composition of hybrid perovskites. The rapid progress in material synthesis and device fabrication has also promoted the development of other optoelectronic applications including light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and transistors. Both experimental and theoretical investigations on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have enabled some critical fundamental understandings of this material system. Recent studies have also demonstrated progress in addressing the potential stability issue, which has been identified as a main challenge for future research on halide perovskites. Here, we review recent progress on hybrid perovskites including basic chemical and crystal structures, chemical synthesis of bulk/nanocrystals and thin films with their chemical and physical properties, device configurations, operation principles for various optoelectronic applications (with a focus on solar cells), and photophysics of charge-carrier dynamics. We also discuss the importance of further understanding of the fundamental properties of hybrid perovskites, especially those related to chemical and structural stabilities. },

SUMMARY Class 2 CRISPR-Cas nucleases are programmable genome editing tools with promising applications in human health and disease. However, DNA cleavage at off-target sites that resemble the target sequence is a pervasive problem that remains poorly understood mechanistically. Here, we use quantitative kinetics to dissect the reaction steps of DNA targeting by Acidaminococcus sp Cas12a (also known as Cpf1). We show that Cas12a binds DNA tightly in two kinetically separable steps. Pro-tospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) recognition is followed by rate-limiting R-loop propagation, leading to inevitable DNA cleavage of both strands. Despite functionally irreversible binding, Cas12a discriminates strongly against mismatches along most of the DNA target sequence. This result implies substantial reversibility during R-loop formation-a late transition state-and defies common descriptions of a ''seed'' region. Our results provide a quantitative basis for the DNA cleavage patterns measured in vivo and observations of greater reported target specificity for Cas12a than for the Cas9 nuclease.},

abstract = {Biological adhesion between cells is critical for development of multicellular organisms and for the function of the adaptive immune system of vertebrates. A gap in understanding of adhesion systems arises from the difficulty of collecting quantitative data on the molecular interactions underlying adhesion, which is typically studied by population statistics such as percent adhesion in the presence of empirically defined forces to separate less adherent cells. Supported lipid bilayers formed on glass surfaces offer a useful model system in which to explore some basic features of molecular interactions in adhesive contacts. We have exploited the lateral mobility of molecules in the supported planar bilayers and fluorescence microscopy to develop a system for measurement of two-dimensional affinities and kinetic rates in contact areas. Affinity measurements are based on a modified Scatchard analysis. Measurements of kinetic rates are based on fluorescence photobleaching after recovery at the level of the entire contact area. This has been coupled to a reaction-diffusion equation that allows calculation of on- and off-rates. We have found that mixtures of ligands in supported planar bilayers can effectively activate T lymphocytes and simultaneously allow monitoring of the immunological synapse. Recent studies in planar bilayers have provided additional insights into organization principles of cell-cell interfaces. Perennial problems in understanding cell-cell communication are yielding to quantitative measurements based on planar bilayers in areas of ligand driven receptor clustering and the role of the actin cytoskeleton in immune cell activation. A major goal for the field is determining quantitative rules involved in signaling complex formation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The goal of this commentary is to discuss many of those issues in a single location. In terms of "Pros," for example, phages can be bactericidal, can increase in number over the course of treatment, tend to only minimally disrupt normal flora, are equally effective against antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, often are easily discovered, seem to be capable of disrupting bacterial biofilms, and can have low inherent toxicities. In addition to these assets, we consider aspects of phage therapy that can contribute to its safety, economics, or convenience, but in ways that are perhaps less essential to the phage potential to combat bacteria. For example, autonomous phage transfer between animals during veterinary application could provide convenience or economic advantages by decreasing the need for repeated phage application, but is not necessarily crucial to therapeutic success. We also consider possible disadvantages to phage use as antibacterial agents. These "Cons," however, tend to be relatively minor.},

We show that other proteins can be targeted to this intracellular filamentous arrangement. Specifically, the enzymes pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase have been directed to the filaments, leading to enhanced ethanol production in these engineered bacterial cells compared to those that do not produce the scaffold. This is consistent with improved metabolic efficiency through enzyme colocation. Finally, the shell-protein scaffold can be directed to the inner membrane of the cell, demonstrating how synthetic cellular organization can be coupled with spatial optimization through in-cell protein design. The cytoscaffold has potential in the development of next-generation cell factories, wherein it could be used to organize enzyme pathways and metabolite transporters to enhance metabolic flux.},

abstract = {Bacteriophage survives in at least two extremes of ionic environments: bacterial host (high ionic-cytosol) and that of soil (low ionic-environmental water). The impact of ionic composition in the micro- and macro-environments has not so far been addressed in phage biology. Here, we discovered a novel mechanism of aggregation/disaggregation transitions by phage virions. When normal sodium levels in phage media (150 mM) were lowered to 10 mM, advanced imaging by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering all revealed formation of viral packages, each containing 20–100 virions. When ionic strength was returned from low to high, the aggregated state of phage reversed to a dispersed state, and the change in ionic strength did not substantially affect infectivity of the phage. By providing the direct evidence, that lowering of the sodium ion below the threshold of 20 mM causes rapid aggregation of phage while returning Na+ concentration to the values above this threshold causes dispersion of phage, we identified a biophysical mechanism of phage aggregation. Our results implicate operation of group behavior in phage and suggest a new kind of quorum sensing among its virions that is mediated by ions. Loss of ionic strength may act as a trigger in an evolutionary mechanism to improve the survival of bacteriophage by stimulating aggregation of phage when outside a bacterial host. Reversal of phage aggregation is also a promising breakthrough in biotechnological applications, since we demonstrated here the ability to retain viable virion aggregates on standard micro-filters.},

Class 1 effectors utilize multi-protein complexes, whereas class 2 effectors rely on single-component effector proteins such as the well-characterized Cas9. Here, we report characterization of Cpf1, a putative class 2 CRISPR effector. We demonstrate that Cpf1 mediates robust DNA interference with features distinct from Cas9. Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease lacking tracrRNA, and it utilizes a T-rich protospacer-adjacent motif. Moreover, Cpf1 cleaves DNA via a staggered DNA double-stranded break. Out of 16 Cpf1-family proteins, we identified two candidate enzymes from Acidaminococcus and Lachnospiraceae, with efficient genome-editing activity in human cells. Identifying this mechanism of interference broadens our understanding of CRISPR-Cas systems and advances their genome editing applications.},

Recently Zhang and Kisch reported, for instance, that RuO2 is a robust and efficient catalyst for room temperature (RT) oxidation of CO by humid air; recall that typical metal oxides do not tolerate humidity. In this contribution we present scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data which directly image the catalytically important processes occurring on the RuO2(110) surface after exposing the pristine surface to CO and O2. These data are complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe following processes are governing the catalytic activity of RuO2 on atomic scale. The reactants from the gas phase encounter strongly binding adsorption sites on the RuO2(110) surface in the form of the under-coordinated Ru atoms. For instance, CO adsorbs on the stoichiometric RuO2(110) surface by 1.2 eV (over the 1f-cus-Ru), while on the reduced RuO2(110) surface the CO binding energies are 1.61 eV and 1.85 eV for adsorption over 1f-cus-Ru and 2f-cus-Ru atoms, respectively. The RuO2 surface provides an active oxygen species to react with CO, i.e. the under-coordinated (bridging) lattice oxygen atoms Obr. The recombination of adsorbed CO with Obr creates vacancies, which are identified with STM. At RT, oxygen molecules from the gas phase can efficiently dissociate on RuO2(110) via the molecular precursor state. This leads to weakly held O atoms, which are grouped in pairs as imaged with STM. It is argued that the weakly held oxygen plays an important role in replenishing the consumed (bridging) lattice oxygen atoms on the (partially) reduced RuO2(110) surface.},

We examine here the effect of sample dynamics as a source of structural heterogeneity on the resolution of the reconstructed image of a small protein molecule. Structures from molecular-dynamics simulations of lysozyme were sampled and aligned. These structures were then used to calculate diffraction patterns corresponding to different dynamic states. The patterns were incoherently summed and the resulting data set was phased using the oversampling method. Reconstructed images of hydrated and dehydrated lysozyme gave resolutions of 3.7 {\AA} and 7.6 {\AA}, respectively. These are significantly worse than the root-mean-square deviation of the hydrated (2.7 {\AA} for all atoms and 1.45 {\AA} for C-$\alpha$ positions) or dehydrated (3.7 {\AA} for all atoms and 2.5 {\AA} for C-$\alpha$ positions) structures. The noise introduced by structural dynamics and incoherent addition of dissimilar structures restricts the maximum resolution to be expected from direct image reconstruction of dynamic systems. A way of potentially reducing this effect is by grouping dynamic structures into distinct structural substates and solving them separately. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

In addition, we show that the standard genetic code couples this structural correlation into a tight evolutionary relationship. We illustrate the extent of this evolutionary entanglement of amyloid propensity and globular protein stability. Suppressing a 600-Ma-conserved amyloidogenic segment in the p53 core domain fold is structurally feasible but requires 7-bp substitutions to concomitantly introduce two aggregation-suppressing and three stabilizing amino acid mutations.

abstract = {Fusion of tomographic radionuclide studies with anatomical examinations has become standard practice in positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Nonetheless, fusion of planar scintigraphic images with an anatomical modality remains distinctly uncommon, although methods to do so have appeared sporadically in the literature during the past 2 decades. In this article we review several techniques that have been used to combine planar scintigraphic images with radiographs and visual (photographic) images. Rigid or affine transformations have been performed to co-register the planar images with each other using custom, commercial, or public domain software. Display of the hybrid images has been achieved primarily with nonselective color-fusion methods. Promising efforts are underway to develop a technique of fusing planar lymphoscintigraphic images with CT topograms (scout images) obtained on the SPECT-CT camera in a manner that compensates for position-dependent variation in magnification that affects the CT scout. An advantage of this approach is that both of the component images are acquired on the same gantry, without need for repositioning of the patient. It is instructive to note that techniques of fusing rectilinear scans with radiographic and visual images were first developed more than 50 years ago. The revisiting of these methods after many decades reflects a fundamental need for spatial orientation in nuclear medicine that fusion imaging can also bring to planar scintigraphic studies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Endothelial cell migration is essential to angiogenesis. This motile process is directionally regulated by chemotactic, haptotactic, and mechanotactic stimuli and further involves degradation of the extracellular matrix to enable progression of the migrating cells. It requires the activation of several signaling pathways that converge on cytoskeletal remodeling. Then, it follows a series of events in which the endothelial cells extend, contract, and throw their rear toward the front and progress forward. The aim of this review is to give an integrative view of the signaling mechanisms that govern endothelial cell migration in the context of angiogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Advances in SPECT and PET imaging hardware, software, and radiotracers are vastly improving the non-invasive evaluation of myocardial perfusion and function. In contrast to traditional dual-headed, sodium iodide crystal and photomultiplier cameras with mechanical collimators, new SPECT camera designs utilize novel, collimators, and solid-state detectors that convert photons directly to electrical signals. These cameras simultaneously collect data from as many as 76 small detectors narrowly focused on the heart. New noise regularization and resolution recovery/noise reduction reconstruction software interprets emitted counts more efficiently and thus more effectively discriminates between useful signals and noise. As a result, shorter acquisition times and/or lower tracer doses produce higher quality SPECT images than were possible before. PET perfusion imaging has benefitted from the introduction of novel detectors that now allow true 3D imaging, new radiopharmaceuticals, and precise attenuation correction (AC). These developments have resulted in perfusion images with higher spatial and contrast resolution that may be acquired in shorter protocols and/or with less patient radiation exposure than traditional SPECT. Hybrid SPECT/CT and PET/CT cameras utilize transmission computed tomographic (CT) scans for AC, and offer the additional clinical advantages of evaluating coronary calcium, myocardial anatomy (including non-invasive CT angiography), myocardial function, and myocardial perfusion in a single imaging procedure.},

The atomic architecture of a spine, from the fibril-forming segment GNNQQNY of the yeast prion protein Sup35, was recently revealed by X-ray microcrystallography. It is a pair of $\beta$-sheets, with the facing side chains of the two sheets interdigitated in a dry 'steric zipper'. Here we report some 30 other segments from fibril-forming proteins that form amyloid-like fibrils, microcrystals, or usually both. These include segments from the Alzheimer's amyloid-$\beta$ and tau proteins, the PrP prion protein, insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), lysozyme, myoglobin, $\alpha$-synuclein and $\beta$2-microglobulin, suggesting that common structural features are shared by amyloid diseases at the molecular level.

They are of key interest not only because of their association with numerous disorders, such as type II diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, but also because of their potential to become engineered high-performance nano-materials. Methods to characterise the length distribution of nano-scale linear aggregates such as amyloid fibrils are of paramount importance both in understanding the biological impact of these aggregates and in controlling their mechanical properties as potential nano-materials. Here, we present a new quantitative approach to the determination of the length distribution of amyloid fibrils using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy. The method described employs single-particle image analysis corrected for the length-dependent bias that is a common problem associated with surface-based imaging techniques. Applying this method, we provide a detailed characterisation of the length distribution of samples containing long-straight fibrils formed in vitro from $\beta$2-microglobulin. The results suggest that the Weibull distribution is a suitable model in describing fibril length distributions, and reveal that fibril fragmentation is an important process even under unagitated conditions. These results demonstrate the significance of quantitative length distribution measurements in providing important new information regarding amyloid assembly.},

Summary: quantification of fibril length distribution using AFM in different conditions

Methods
* generate sample with different seed concentrations and stirring conditions
* plating and AFM image analysis
* bias correction: assuming amount of monomers is equal in different samples and adjust measurements to correct for that
* MLE estimation to fit different distributions, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for assessing fit quality

Conclusions:
* Weibull (or gamma) distribution seem appropriate
* difference between samples 1 and 2 (diff seeding concentration, no stirring) suggests fibril fragmentation is significicant even when not stirring samples},

abstract = {Since their introduction by Hal Anger in the late 1950s, the gamma cameras have been widely used in the field of nuclear medicine. The original concept is based on the association of a large field of view scintillator optically coupled with an array of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), in order to locate the position of interactions inside the crystal. Using a dedicated accessory, like a parallel hole collimator, to focus the field of view toward a predefined direction, it is possible to built up an image of the radioactive distribution. In terms of imaging performances, three main characteristics are commonly considered: uniformity, spatial resolution and energy resolution. Major improvements were mainly due to progress in terms of industrial process regarding analogical electronic, crystal growing or PMTs manufacturing. Today's gamma camera is highly digital, from the PMTs to the display. All the corrections are applied "on the fly" using up to date signal processing techniques. At the same time some significant progresses have been achieved in the field of collimators. Finally, two new technologies have been implemented, solid detectors like CdTe or CdZnTe, and pixellized scintillators plus photodiodes or position sensitive photomultiplier tubes. These solutions are particularly well adapted to build dedicated gamma camera for breast or intraoperative imaging. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Microtubules are highly dynamic protein polymers that form a crucial part of the cytoskeleton in all eukaryotic cells. Although microtubules are known to self-assemble from tubulin dimers, information on the assembly dynamics of microtubules has been limited, both in vitro and in vivo, to measurements of average growth and shrinkage rates over several thousands of tubulin subunits. As a result there is a lack of information on the sequence of molecular events that leads to the growth and shrinkage of microtubule ends. Here we use optical tweezers to observe the assembly dynamics of individual microtubules at molecular resolution. We find that microtubules can increase their overall length almost instantaneously by amounts exceeding the size of individual dimers (8 nm). When the microtubule-associated protein XMAP215 (ref. 6) is added, this effect is markedly enhanced and fast increases in length of about 40-60 nm are observed. These observations suggest that small tubulin oligomers are able to add directly to growing microtubules and that XMAP215 speeds up microtubule growth by facilitating the addition of long oligomers. The achievement of molecular resolution on the microtubule assembly process opens the way to direct studies of the molecular mechanism by which the many recently discovered microtubule end-binding proteins regulate microtubule dynamics in living cells.},

abstract = {It has been suggested for several years that reactions between ligands and cell surface receptors can be speeded up by nonspecific adsorption of the ligand to the cell surface followed by two-dimensional surface diffusion to the receptor, a mechanism referred to as "reduction-of-dimensionality" (RD) rate enhancement. Most of the theoretical treatments of this and related problems have assumed that the receptor is an irreversibly absorbing perfect sink. Such receptors induce a depletion zone of ligand probability density around themselves. The reaction rate in this case (called "diffusion-limited") is limited only by the time required for ligands to diffuse through this depletion zone. In some cases, however, the receptor may be far from "perfect" such that a collision with a ligand only rarely leads to binding. Receptors then do not create significant local depletion zones of ligand probability density, and the reaction rate becomes strongly affected by the (small) probability of reaction success per diffusive encounter (the "reaction-limited" case). This article presents a simple theory of RD rate enhancement for reaction-limited receptors that are either reversible or irreversible binders. In contrast to the diffusion-limited theories, the reaction-limited theory presented here: (a) differs quantitatively from diffusion-limited models; (b) is simple and algebraic in closed form; (c) exhibits significant rate enhancement in some realistic cases; (d) depends strongly on the actual Brownian rather than pure diffusive nature of the ligand's motion; (e) depends (for irreversibly binding receptors only) on the kinetic rates (not just equilibria) of reversible adsorption to nontarget regions, in contrast to some previous approximate theories of reduction of dimensionality; and (f) is applicable to actual ligand/receptor systems with binding success probabilities at the opposite extreme from the perfect sink/diffusion-limited models.},

This study analyzed morphological and molecular changes induced in co-cultured human fibroblasts (HFs) and the MG-63 osteosarcoma cell line. Co-cultured cell monolayers were morphologically analyzed using high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), and trans-well assays were performed to assess cell migration and invasion. Proteins involved in inflammatory responses, cancer cell invasion, and angiogenesis were assessed using western blotting. HR-SEM showed progressive spatial orientation loss by fibroblasts in contact with MG-63s, while MG-63s proliferated rapidly and invaded HF space. Trans-well assays showed enhanced MG-63 migration in the presence of HFs. IL-6 expression was increased in co-cultured HFs, possibly stimulated by TNF-$\alpha$. HFs do not normally express YKL-40 but did so in co-culture. Band densitometric analyses showed that increasing YKL-40 expression was followed by VEGF overexpression, especially in MG-63s. Finally, our results confirmed fibroblasts as the main matrix metalloproteinase source in this tumor microenvironment. Our study sheds new light on how tumor-stroma interactions promote tumor development and progression, and may support identification of novel anti-cancer therapeutics.},

Amyloid fibrils also have potential applications in nano-engineering of biomaterials. The kinetics of amyloid assembly show an exponential growth phase preceded by a lag phase, variable in duration as seen in bulk experiments and experiments that mimic the small volumes of cells. Here, to investigate the origins and the properties of the observed variability in the lag phase of amyloid assembly currently not accounted for by deterministic nucleation dependent mechanisms, we formulate a new stochastic minimal model that is capable of describing the characteristics of amyloid growth curves despite its simplicity. We then solve the stochastic differential equations of our model and give mathematical proof of a central limit theorem for the sample growth trajectories of the nucleated aggregation process. These results give an asymptotic description for our simple model, from which closed form analytical results capable of describing and predicting the variability of nucleated amyloid assembly were derived. We also demonstrate the application of our results to inform experiments in a conceptually friendly and clear fashion. Our model offers a new perspective and paves the way for a new and efficient approach on extracting vital information regarding the key initial events of amyloid formation.},

The rotating-polarizer method was used to separate the optical effects of transmission, linear birefringence, extinction, linear dichroism, and orientation of the electric dipole transition moments and to display them as false-color maps. These effects are typically convolved in an ordinary polarized light microscope. In this way, we show that the amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease plaques contain structurally disordered centers, providing clues to mechanisms of crystallization of amyloid in vivo. Comparisons are made with plaques from tissues of subjects having Down's syndrome and a prion disease. In plaques characteristic of each disease, the Congo red molecules are oriented radially. The optical orientation in amyloid deposited in blood vessels from subjects having cerebral amyloid angiopathy was 90° out of phase from that in the plaques, suggesting that the fibrils run tangentially with respect to the circumference of the blood vessels. Our result supports an early model in which Congo red molecules are aligned along the long fiber axis and is in contrast to the most recent binding models that are based on computation. This investigation illustrates that the latest methods for the optical analysis of heterogeneous substances are useful for in situ study of amyloid.},

We study various properties of the droplet and find, in particular, that in a wide range of parameters its excitation spectrum lies entirely above the particle emission threshold. The droplet thus automatically evaporates itself to zero temperature, the property potentially interesting by itself and from the viewpoint of sympathetic cooling of other systems.},

However, signal to noise ratio (SNR) and temporal resolution are still a concern, especially deep inside living cells and organisms. In this work, we developed a non-deterministic scanning approach based on a real-time feedback system which speeds up the acquisition up to 6-fold and decreases the light dose by 70–90{\%} for in vivo imaging. Also, we extended the information content of the images by acquiring the complete temporal evolution of the fluorescence generated by reversible switchable fluorescent proteins. This generates a series of images with different spatial resolution and SNR, from conventional to RESOLFT images, which combined through a multi-image deconvolution algorithm further enhances the effective resolution. We reported nanoscale imaging of organelles up to 35 Hz and actin dynamics during an invasion process at a depth of 20–30 µm inside a living Caenorhabditis elegans worm.},

Light from this point source is focused upon a specimen to be enlarged to illuminate a point observation field included in the specimen. The illuminated point is then focused as an image of the point upon a pinhole aperture, and the light intensity of the image measured by a photosensitive device. While the optical system remains fixed, means are provided to move the specimen in a selected pattern across the focal point of illumination so that a selected area of the specimen traverses and is examined by the point of light. This scanning pattern traversed by the specimen is reproduced by an identical scanning pattern or raster upon a display device, such as a cathode ray tube, to which is also fed the signal from the photosensitive device. The raster area greatly exceeds the selected area of the specimen. As a result, an image of the second specimen area is reproduced on a highly enlarged scale in the raster of the cathode ray tube.},

The best studied of these is the prion domain (NM) of Sup35, which forms an amyloid that can adopt several distinct conformations (strains) that produce distinct phenotypes. Using magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we provide a detailed look at the dynamic properties of these forms over a broad range of timescales. We establish that different prion strains have distinct amyloid structures, with many side chains in different chemical environments. Surprisingly, the prion strain with a larger fraction of rigid residues also has a larger fraction of highly mobile residues. Differences in mobility correlate with differences in interaction with the prion-partitioning factor Hsp104 in vivo, perhaps explaining strain-specific differences in inheritance. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Hell2015a,
abstract = {Far-field optical microscopy using focused light is an important tool in a number of scientific disciplines including chemical, (bio)physical and biomedical research, particularly with respect to the study of living cells and organisms. Unfortunately, the applicability of the optical microscope is limited, since the diffraction of light imposes limitations on the spatial resolution of the image. Consequently the details of, for example, cellular protein distributions, can be visualized only to a certain extent. Fortunately, recent years have witnessed the development of 'super-resolution' far-field optical microscopy (nanoscopy) techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED), ground state depletion (GSD), reversible saturated optical (fluorescence) transitions (RESOLFT), photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), structured illumination microscopy (SIM) or saturated structured illumination microscopy (SSIM), all in one way or another addressing the problem of the limited spatial resolution of far-field optical microscopy. While SIM achieves a two-fold improvement in spatial resolution compared to conventional optical microscopy, STED, RESOLFT, PALM/STORM, or SSIM have all gone beyond, pushing the limits of optical image resolution to the nanometer scale. Consequently, all super-resolution techniques open new avenues of biomedical research. Because the field is so young, the potential capabilities of different super-resolution microscopy approaches have yet to be fully explored, and uncertainties remain when considering the best choice of methodology. Thus, even for experts, the road to the future is sometimes shrouded in mist. The super-resolution optical microscopy roadmap of Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics addresses this need for clarity. It provides guidance to the outstanding questions through a collection of short review articles from experts in the field, giving a thorough discussion on the concepts underlying super-resolution optical microscopy, the potential of different approaches, the importance of label optimization (such as reversible photoswitchable proteins) and applications in which these methods will have a significant impact.

abstract = {The three-dimensional positions of atoms in protein molecules define their structure and their roles in biological processes. The more precisely atomic coordinates are determined, the more chemical information can be derived and the more mechanistic insights into protein function may be inferred. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis has yielded protein structures with increasing levels of detail in recent years1,2. However, it has proved difficult to obtain cryo-EM reconstructions with sufficient resolution to visualize individual atoms in proteins. Here we use a new electron source, energy filter and camera to obtain a 1.7 {\AA} resolution cryo-EM reconstruction for a human membrane protein, the $\beta$3 GABAA receptor homopentamer3. Such maps allow a detailed understanding of small-molecule coordination, visualization of solvent molecules and alternative conformations for multiple amino acids, and unambiguous building of ordered acidic side chains and glycans. Applied to mouse apoferritin, our strategy led to a 1.22 {\AA} resolution reconstruction that offers a genuine atomic-resolution view of a protein molecule using single-particle cryo-EM. Moreover, the scattering potential from many hydrogen atoms can be visualized in difference maps, allowing a direct analysis of hydrogen-bonding networks. Our technological advances, combined with further approaches to accelerate data acquisition and improve sample quality, provide a route towards routine application of cryo-EM in high-throughput screening of small molecule modulators and structure-based drug discovery.},

First, interactions between RAD51 and the BRC3 or BRC4 regions of BRCA2 block nucleoprotein filament formation by RAD51. Alterations to the BRC3 region that mimic cancer-associated BRCA2 mutations fail to exhibit this effect. Second, transport of RAD51 to the nucleus is defective in cells carrying a cancer-associated BRCA2 truncation. Thus, BRCA2 regulates both the intracellular localization and DNA binding ability of RAD51. Loss of these controls following BRCA2 inactivation may be a key event leading to genomic instability and tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {Super-resolution techniques have begun to transform biological and biomedical research by allowing researchers to observe structures well below the classic diffraction limit of light. DNA points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) offers an easy-to-implement approach to localization-based super-resolution microscopy, owing to the use of DNA probes. In DNA-PAINT, transient binding of short dye-labeled ('imager') oligonucleotides to their complementary target ('docking') strands creates the necessary 'blinking' to enable stochastic super-resolution microscopy. Using the programmability and specificity of DNA molecules as imaging and labeling probes allows researchers to decouple blinking from dye photophysics, alleviating limitations of current super-resolution techniques, making them compatible with virtually any single-molecule-compatible dye. Recent developments in DNA-PAINT have enabled spectrally unlimited multiplexing, precise molecule counting and ultra-high, molecular-scale (sub-5-nm) spatial resolution, reaching 1/41-nm localization precision. DNA-PAINT can be applied to a multitude of in vitro and cellular applications by linking docking strands to antibodies. Here, we present a protocol for the key aspects of the DNA-PAINT framework for both novice and expert users. This protocol describes the creation of DNA origami test samples, in situ sample preparation, multiplexed data acquisition, data simulation, super-resolution image reconstruction and post-processing such as drift correction, molecule counting (qPAINT) and particle averaging. Moreover, we provide an integrated software package, named Picasso, for the computational steps involved. The protocol is designed to be modular, so that individual components can be chosen and implemented per requirements of a specific application. The procedure can be completed in 1-2 d.},

It is important, however, to determine the kinetic parameters of the reaction catalyzed by whole cells, if the process is to be designed with the catalyst in this form. The reaction stoichiometry was established, a mole of product being formed from a mole of each reactant, with no indication of side reactions under the conditions used. The two-substrate reaction kinetics were characterized and modelled, assuming an enzyme-substituted mechanism and no product inhibition. Theoretical consumption rates of indole were compared with experimental values obtained in a batch reactor system. The Kmvalues of whole cells towards L-serine and indole were 1.79 M and 0.07 M, respectively. These values are, as expected, considerably higher than their counterparts for soluble tryptophanase.},

Here, we combine kinetic analyses with quantitative binding measurements to address the mechanism of action of four clinical stage anti-A$\beta$ antibodies, aducanumab, gantenerumab, bapineuzumab and solanezumab. We quantify the influence of these antibodies on the aggregation kinetics and on the production of oligomeric aggregates and link these effects to the affinity and stoichiometry of each antibody for monomeric and fibrillar forms of A$\beta$.

One of the most exciting, yet also controversial, advances in label technology is the emerging development of quantum dots (QDs) - inorganic nanocrystals with unique optical and chemical properties but complicated surface chemistry - as in vitro and in vivo fluorophores. Here we compare and evaluate the differences in physicochemical properties of common fluorescent labels, focusing on traditional organic dyes and QDs. Our aim is to provide a better understanding of the advantages and limitations of both classes of chromophores, to facilitate label choice and to address future challenges in the rational design and manipulation of QD labels.},

abstract = {Conventional asymmetric PCR is inefficient and difficult to optimize because limiting the concentration of one primer lowers its melting temperature below the reaction annealing temperature. Linear-After-The-Exponential (LATE)-PCR describes a new paradigm for primer design that renders assays as efficient as symmetric PCR assays, regardless of primer ratio. LATE-PCR generates single-stranded products with predictable kinetics for many cycles beyond the exponential phase. LATE-PCR also introduces new probe design criteria that uncouple hybridization probe detection from primer annealing and extension, increase probe reliability, improve allele discrimination, and increase signal strength by 80-250{\%} relative to symmetric PCR. These improvements in PCR are particularly useful for real-time quantitative analysis of target numbers in small samples. LATE-PCR is adaptable to high throughput applications in fields such as clinical diagnostics, biodefense, forensics, and DNA sequencing. We showcase LATE-PCR via amplification of the cystic fibrosis CFDelta508 allele and the Tay-Sachs disease TSD 1278 allele from single heterozygous cells.},

abstract = {Integrins are transmembrane receptors that, upon activation, bind extracellular ligands and link them to the actin filament (F-actin) cytoskeleton to mediate cell adhesion and migration. Cytoskeletal forces in migrating cells generated by polymerization- or contractility-driven “retrograde flow” of F-actin from the cell leading edge have been hypothesized to mediate integrin activation for ligand binding. This predicts that these forces should align and orient activated, ligand-bound integrins at the leading edge. Here, polarization-sensitive fluorescence microscopy of GFP-$\alpha$V$\beta$3 integrins in fibroblasts shows that integrins are coaligned in a specific orientation within focal adhesions (FAs) in a manner dependent on binding immobilized ligand and a talin-mediated linkage to the F-actin cytoskeleton. These findings, together with Rosetta modeling, suggest that integrins in FA are coaligned and may be highly tilted by cytoskeletal forces. Thus, the F-actin cytoskeleton sculpts an anisotropic molecular scaffold in FAs, and this feature may underlie the ability of migrating cells to sense directional extracellular cues.},

abstract = {For phytoplankton and other microbes, nutrient receptors are often the passages through which viruses invade. This presents a bottom-up vs. top-down, co-limitation scenario; how do these would-be-hosts balance minimizing viral susceptibility with maximizing uptake of limiting nutrient(s)? This question has been addressed in the biological literature on evolutionary timescales for populations, but a shorter timescale, mechanistic perspective is lacking, and marine viral literature suggests the strong influence of additional factors, e.g. host size; while the literature on both nutrient uptake and host-virus interactions is expansive, their intersection, of ubiquitous relevance to marine environments, is understudied. I present a simple, mechanistic model from first principles to analyze the effect of this co-limitation scenario on individual growth, which suggests that in environments with high risk of viral invasion or spatial/temporal heterogeneity, an individual host's growth rate may be optimized with respect to receptor coverage, producing top-down selective pressure on short timescales. The model has general applicability, is suggestive of hypotheses for empirical exploration, and can be extended to theoretical studies of more complex behaviors and systems.},

abstract = {The etiology of schizophrenia remains unknown. However, using molecular biological techniques, some candidate genes have been identified that might be associated with the disease. One of these candidate genes, disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), was found in a large Scottish family with multiple mental illnesses. The function of DISC1 is considered to be associated with axon elongation and neuron migration in the central nervous system, but the functional consequences of defects in this gene have not been fully clarified in brain neuronal systems. Dysfunction of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neuronal system is also considered to contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Thus, to clarify the neuropathological changes associated with DISC1 dysfunction, we investigated the number and distribution of GABAergic neurons in the prefrontal cortex of DISC1 knockout mice. We immunohistochemically quantified the laminar density of GABAergic neurons using anti-parvalbumin and anti-calbindin D28k antibodies (markers of GABAergic neuronal subpopulations). We found that the densities of both parvalbumin- and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons in the anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal, and orbitofrontal cortices were markedly lower in DISC1 knockout mice than in wild-type mice. In addition, reductions in cell density were observed in layers II and III and the deep layers of the cortex. This reduction in GABAergic neuronal density was not associated with alterations in neuronal size. These findings suggest that disrupted GABAergic neuronal network formation due to a DISC1 deficit might be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.},

Due to their small size, however, the spectroscopic characterisation of species encapsulated in such systems remains challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate the acquisition of infrared spectra from single microdroplets containing aggregation-prone proteins. To this effect, droplets are generated in a microfluidic flow-focussing device and subsequently deposited in a square array onto a ZnSe prism using a micro stamp. After drying, the solutes present in the droplets are illuminated locally by an infrared laser through the prism, and their thermal expansion upon absorption of infrared radiation is measured with an atomic force microscopy tip, granting nanoscale resolution. Using this approach, we resolve structural differences in the amide bands of the spectra of monomeric and aggregated lysozyme from single microdroplets with picolitre volume. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {DNA double-strand break (DSB) signalling and repair is crucial to preserve genomic integrity and maintain cellular homeostasis. p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) is an important regulator of the cellular response to DSBs that promotes the end-joining of distal DNA ends, which is induced during V(D)J and class switch recombination as well as during the fusion of deprotected telomeres. New insights have been gained into the mechanisms underlying the recruitment of 53BP1 to damaged chromatin and how 53BP1 promotes non-homologous end-joining-mediated DSB repair while preventing homologous recombination. From these studies, a model is emerging in which 53BP1 recruitment requires the direct recognition of a DSB-specific histone code and its influence on pathway choice is mediated by mutual antagonism with breast cancer 1 (BRCA1).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: First introduced in 2006, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) has stirred great interest, as evidenced by 75 publications as of October 2015, with 56 of them just in the last 2 years. The widespread adop- tion of this isothermal molecular tool in many diagnostic fields represents an affordable (approximately 4.3 USD per test), simple (few and easy hands-on steps), fast (results within 5–20 min), and sensitive (single target copy number detected)methodfor the identification of pathogensandthe detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms in human cancers and genetically modified organisms. CONTENT: This review summarizes the current knowl- edge on RPA. The molecular diagnostics of various RNA/DNApathogens is discussed while highlighting re- cent applications in clinical settings with focus on point- of-care (POC) bioassays and on automated fluidic plat- forms. The strengths and limitations of this isothermal method are also addressed. SUMMARY: RPA is becoming a molecular tool of choice for the rapid, specific, and cost-effective identification of pathogens. Owing to minimal sample-preparation require- ments, low operation temperature (25–42 °C), and com- mercial availability of freeze-dried reagents, this method has been applied outside laboratory settings, in remote areas, and interestingly, onboard automated sample-to-answer microfluidic devices. RPA is undoubtedly a promising iso- thermal molecular technique for clinical microbiology lab- oratories and emergence response in clinical settings.},

The international sample comprised 19,581 carriers of BRCA1 mutations and 11,900 carriers of BRCA2 mutations from 55 centers in 33 countries on 6 continents. We estimated hazard ratios for breast and ovarian cancer based on mutation type, function, and nucleotide position. We also estimated RHR, the ratio of breast vs ovarian cancer hazard ratios. A value of RHR greater than 1 indicated elevated breast cancer risk; a value of RHR less than 1 indicated elevated ovarian cancer risk.Exposures: Mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2.Main Outcomes and Measures: Breast and ovarian cancer risks.Results: Among BRCA1 mutation carriers, 9052 women (46{\%}) were diagnosed with breast cancer, 2317 (12{\%}) with ovarian cancer, 1041 (5{\%}) with breast and ovarian cancer, and 7171 (37{\%}) without cancer. Among BRCA2 mutation carriers, 6180 women (52{\%}) were diagnosed with breast cancer, 682 (6{\%}) with ovarian cancer, 272 (2{\%}) with breast and ovarian cancer, and 4766 (40{\%}) without cancer. In BRCA1, we identified 3 breast cancer cluster regions (BCCRs) located at c.179 to c.505 (BCCR1; RHR = 1.46; 95{\%} CI, 1.22-1.74; P = 2 × 10(-6)), c.4328 to c.4945 (BCCR2; RHR = 1.34; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-1.78; P = .04), and c. 5261 to c.5563 (BCCR2', RHR = 1.38; 95{\%} CI, 1.22-1.55; P = 6 × 10(-9)). We also identified an ovarian cancer cluster region (OCCR) from c.1380 to c.4062 (approximately exon 11) with RHR = 0.62 (95{\%} CI, 0.56-0.70; P = 9 × 10(-17)). In BRCA2, we observed multiple BCCRs spanning c.1 to c.596 (BCCR1; RHR = 1.71; 95{\%} CI, 1.06-2.78; P = .03), c.772 to c.1806 (BCCR1'; RHR = 1.63; 95{\%} CI, 1.10-2.40; P = .01), and c.7394 to c.8904 (BCCR2; RHR = 2.31; 95{\%} CI, 1.69-3.16; P = .00002). We also identified 3 OCCRs: the first (OCCR1) spanned c.3249 to c.5681 that was adjacent to c.5946delT (6174delT; RHR = 0.51; 95{\%} CI, 0.44-0.60; P = 6 × 10(-17)). The second OCCR spanned c.6645 to c.7471 (OCCR2; RHR = 0.57; 95{\%} CI, 0.41-0.80; P = .001). Mutations conferring nonsense-mediated decay were associated with differential breast or ovarian cancer risks and an earlier age of breast cancer diagnosis for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.Conclusions and Relevance: Breast and ovarian cancer risks varied by type and location of BRCA1/2 mutations. With appropriate validation, these data may have implications for risk assessment and cancer prevention decision making for carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.},

abstract = {As a result of the overwhelming preoccupation with uncovering the process of radicalization into terrorist ac- tivity, little attention has been paid to the related, yet distinct processes of disengagement and deradicalization from terrorism. This continuing neglect is ironic because it may be in the analysis of disengagement that practi- cal initiatives for counterterrorism may become more apparent in their development and feasible in their execu- tion. While a variety of deradicalization initiatives worldwide are currently receiving enormous interest from afar, it is inevitable they will be subjected to intense scrutiny regarding their alleged outcomes and claimed successes. A more immediate challenge, however, is to assert some conceptual and terminological clarity. While deradicalization has become the latest buzzword in counterterrorism, it is critical that we distinguish it from disengagement and stress that not only are they different, but that just because one leaves terrorism be- hind; it rarely implies (or even necessitates) that one become ‘deradicalized'. One of several implications aris- ing from this distinction may be a more realistic appraisal of how our knowledge and understanding of the dis- engagement processes (and not undefined and poorly conceptualised deradicalization efforts) may be put to effective use in the short-medium term development of research agendas.},

Recent evidence has implicated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in various DNA repair pathways and in the maintenance of genomic stability. The inhibition of PARP1 is therefore being exploited clinically for the treatment of various cancers, which include DNA repair-deficient ovarian, breast and prostate cancers. Understanding
the role of PARP1 in maintaining genome integrity is not only important for the design of novel chemotherapeutic agents, but is also crucial for gaining insights into the mechanisms of chemoresistance in cancer cells. In this Review, we discuss the roles of PARP1 in mediating various aspects of DNA metabolism, such as single-strand break repair, nucleotide excision repair, double-strand break repair and the stabilization of replication forks, and in modulating chromatin structure.},

abstract = {Application of surface-science techniques, such as XPS, SXRD, STM, and IR spectroscopy under catalytic reactions conditions yield new structural and chemical information. Recent experiments focusing on CO oxidation over Pt and Pd model catalysts were reviewed. Platinum and palladium are frequently used as catalytic materials, for example for the oxidation of CO. This is one of the most widely studied reactions in the field of surface science. Although seemingly uncomplicated, it remains an active and interesting topic, which is partially explained by the push to conduct experiments on model systems under relevant reaction conditions. Recent developments in the surface-science methodology have allowed obtaining chemical and structural information on the active phase of model catalysts. Tools of the trade include near-ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-pressure scanning tunneling microscopy, high-pressure surface X-ray diffraction, and high-pressure vibrational spectroscopy. Interpretation is often aided by density functional theory in combination with thermodynamic and kinetic modeling. In this review, results for the catalytic oxidation of CO obtained by these techniques are compared. On several of the Pt and Pd surfaces, new structures develop in excess O 2 . For Pt, this requires a much larger excess of O 2 than for Pd. Most of these structures also develop in pure O 2 and are identified as (surface) oxides. A large body of evidence supports the conjecture that these oxides are more reactive than the corresponding O-covered metallic surfaces under similar conditions, although still debated in the literature. An outlook on this developing field, including directions that move away from CO oxidation towards more complex chemistry, concludes this review. },

abstract = {Tumorigenesis often involves specific changes in cell motility and intercellular adhesion. Understanding the collective cancer cell behavior associated with these specific changes could facilitate the detection of malignant characteristics during tumor growth and invasion. In this study, a cellular vertex model is developed to investigate the collective dynamics of a disk-like aggregate of cancer cells confined in a confluent monolayer of normal cells. The effects of intercellular adhesion and cell motility on tumor progression are examined. It is found that the stresses in both the cancer cells and the normal cells increase with tumor growth, resulting in a crowded environment and enhanced cell apoptosis. The intercellular adhesion between cancer cells and normal cells is revealed to promote tumor growth and invasion. The tumor invasion dynamics hinges on the motility of cancer cells. The cancer cells could orchestrate into different collective migration modes, e.g., directional migration and rotational oscillations, dictated by the competition between cell persistence and local coordination. Phase diagrams are established to reveal the competitive mechanisms. This work highlights the role of mechanics in regulating tumor growth and invasion.},

abstract = {It is shown that adsorbability of T4 is regularly correlated with the extended state of the tail fibers, suggesting that in T4 fiber extension is a necessary condition for adsorption. Furthermore the extension and retraction of fibers is correlated with the dual sedimentation of T4 observed during ultracentrifugation. For T4, 38, which requires tryptophan for adsorption, electron microscopy shows the tail fibers to be extended in the presence of tryptophan and retracted in its absence. Phages with retracted fibers (no tryptophan) show a faster sedimentation than those with extended fibers (with tryptophan). In the absence of tryptophan T4, 38 does not show fiber extension even at pH 7, a condition sufficient for nontryptophan-requiring T4, whose fibers are retracted at pH 5. A conditional lethal mutation in gene 37 of phage T4D results in phages which lack tail fibers entirely. These phages no longer adsorb. In the ultracentrifuge, only the fast form can be observed whether at pH 7 or 5. Phages with extended fibers are more rapidly inactivated by ultrasonic waves than phages with retracted fibers. Measurements on electron micrographs show that the head size of T4 is invariant. A model of the functioning fiber apparatus is proposed and discussed. {\textcopyright} 1965.},

Even though all mature amyloid fibrils must originate as oligomers, we found that most A$\beta$42 oligomers dissociate into their monomeric precursors without forming new fibrils. Only a minority of oligomers converts into fibrillar structures. Moreover, the heterogeneous ensemble of oligomeric species interconverts on timescales comparable to those of aggregation. Our results identify fundamentally new steps that could be targeted by therapeutic interventions designed to combat protein misfolding diseases. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

abstract = {IR spectroscopy is an excellent method for biological analyses. It enables the nonperturbative, label-free extraction of biochemical information and images toward diagnosis and the assessment of cell functionality. Although not strictly microscopy in the conventional sense, it allows the construction of images of tissue or cell architecture by the passing of spectral data through a variety of computational algorithms. Because such images are constructed from fingerprint spectra, the notion is that they can be an objective reflection of the underlying health status of the analyzed sample. One of the major difficulties in the field has been determining a consensus on spectral pre-processing and data analysis. This manuscript brings together as coauthors some of the leaders in this field to allow the standardization of methods and procedures for adapting a multistage approach to a methodology that can be applied to a variety of cell biological questions or used within a clinical setting for disease screening or diagnosis. We describe a protocol for collecting IR spectra and images from biological samples (e.g., fixed cytology and tissue sections, live cells or biofluids) that assesses the instrumental options available, appropriate sample preparation, different sampling modes as well as important advances in spectral data acquisition. After acquisition, data processing consists of a sequence of steps including quality control, spectral pre-processing, feature extraction and classification of the supervised or unsupervised type. A typical experiment can be completed and analyzed within hours. Example results are presented on the use of IR spectra combined with multivariate data processing. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nature America, Inc.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibril formation is associated with misfolding diseases, as well as fulfilling a functional role. The cross-$\beta$ molecular architecture has been reported in increasing numbers of amyloidlike fibrillar systems. The Waltz algorithm is able to predict ordered self-assembly of amyloidogenic peptides by taking into account the residue type and position. This algorithm has expanded the amyloid sequence space, and in the present study we characterize the structures of amyloid-like fibrils formed by three peptides identified by Waltz that form fibrils but not crystals. The structural challenge is met by combining electron microscopy, linear dichroism, CD and X-ray fibre diffraction. We propose structures that reveal a cross-$\beta$ conformation with 'steric-zipper' features, giving insights into the role for side chains in peptide packing and stability within fibrils. The amenity of these peptides to structural characterization makes them compelling model systems to use for understanding the relationship between sequence, self-assembly, stability and structure of amyloid fibrils. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biochemical Society.},

abstract = {The linear response theory has given a general proof of the fluctuation- dissipation theorem which states that the linear response of a given system to an external perturbation is expressed in terms of fluctuation properties of the system in thermal equilibrium. This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed. 1.},

abstract = {Phage therapy is the application of bacteria-specific viruses with the goal of reducing or eliminating pathogenic or nuisance bacteria. While phage therapy has become a broadly relevant technology, including veterinary, agricultural, and food microbiology applications, it is for the treatment or prevention of human infections that phage therapy first caught the world's imagination--see, especially, Arrowsmith by Sinclair Lewis (1925)--and which today is the primary motivator of the field. Nonetheless, though the first human phage therapy took place in the 1920s, by the 1940s the field, was in steep decline despite early promise. The causes were at least three-fold: insufficient understanding among researchers of basic phage biology; over exuberance, which led, along with ignorance, to carelessness; and the advent of antibiotics, an easier to handle as well as highly powerful category of antibacterials. The decline in phage therapy was neither uniform nor complete, especially in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia, where phage therapy traditions and practice continue to this day. In this review we strive toward three goals: 1. To provide an overview of the potential of phage therapy as a means of treating or preventing human diseases; 2. To explore the phage therapy state of the art as currently practiced by physicians in various pockets of phage therapy activity around the world, including in terms of potential commercialization; and 3. To avert a recapitulation of phage therapy's early decline by outlining good practices in phage therapy practice, experimentation, and, ultimately, commercialization.},

The IR spectral data of polymers are usually interpreted in terms of the vibrations of a structural repeat.

Amide I bands (1,700-1,600 cm -1) are the most prominent and sensitive vibrational bands of the protein backbone, and they relate to protein secondary structural components. In this protocol, we have detailed the principles that underlie the determination of protein secondary structure by FTIR spectroscopy, as well as the basic steps involved in protein sample preparation, instrument operation, FTIR spectra collection and spectra analysis in order to estimate protein secondary-structural components in aqueous (both H 2 O and deuterium oxide (D 2 O)) solution using algorithms, such as second-derivative, deconvolution and curve fitting.

abstract = {The fascination for lanthanide optical spectroscopy dates back to the 1880s when renowned scientists such as Sir William Crookes, LeCoq de Boisbaudran, Eug{\`{e}}ne Demar{\c{c}}ay or, later, Georges Urbain were using luminescence as an analytical tool to test the purity of their crystallizations and to identify potential new elements. The richness and complexity of lanthanide optical spectra are reflected in an article published in 1937 by J.H. van Vleck: The Puzzle of Rare Earth Spectra in Solids. After this analytical and exploratory period, lanthanide unique optical properties were taken advantage of in optical glasses, filters, and lasers. In the mid-1970s, E. Soini and I. Hemmil{\"{a}} proposed lanthanide luminescent probes for time-resolved immunoassays (Soini and Hemmil{\"{a}} in Clin Chem 25:353–361, 1979) and this has been the starting point of the present numerous bio-applications based on optical properties of lanthanides. In this chapter, we first briefly outline the principles underlying the simplest models used for describing the electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of trivalent lanthanide ions LnIII (4f n ) with special emphasis on luminescence. Since the book is intended for a broad readership within the sciences, we start from scratch defining all quantities used, but we stay at a descriptive level, leaving out detailed mathematical developments. For the latter, the reader is referred to references Liu and Jacquier, Spectroscopic properties of rare earths in optical materials. Tsinghua University Press {\&} Springer, Beijing {\&} Heidelberg, 2005 and G{\"{o}}rller-Walrand and Binnemans, Rationalization of crystal field parameters. In: Gschneidner, Eyring (eds) Handbook on the physics and chemistry of rare earths, vol 23. Elsevier BV, Amsterdam, Ch 155, 1996. The second part of the chapter is devoted to practical aspects of lanthanide luminescent probes, both from the point of view of their design and of their potential utility.},

abstract = {The wac gene product (gpwac) or fibritin of bacteriophage T4 forms the six fibers that radiate from the phage neck. During phage morphogenesis these whiskers bind the long tail fibers (LTFs) and facilitate their attachment to the phage baseplate. After the cell lysis, the gpwac fibers function as part of an environmental sensing device that retains the LTFs in a retracted configuration and thus prevents phage adsorption in unfavorable conditions. A comparative analysis of the sequences of 5 wac gene orthologs from various T4-type phages reveals that the approximately 50-amino-acid N-terminal domain is the only highly conserved segment of the protein. This sequence conservation is probably a direct consequence of the domain's strong and specific interactions with the neck proteins. The sequence of the central fibrous region of gpwac is highly plastic, with only the heptad periodicity of the coiled-coil structure being conserved. In the various gpwac sequences, the small C-terminal domain essential for initiation of the folding of T4 gpwac is replaced by unrelated sequences of unknown origin. When a distant T4-type phage has a novel C-terminal gpwac sequence, the phage's gp36 sequence that is located at the knee joint of the LTF invariably has a novel domain in its C terminus as well. The covariance of these two sequences is compatible with genetic data suggesting that the C termini of gpwac and gp36 engage in a protein-protein interaction that controls phage infectivity. These results add to the limited evidence for domain swapping in the evolution of phage structural proteins.},

abstract = {For about a decade, superresolution fluorescence microscopy has been advancing steadily, maturing from the proof-of-principle stage to routine application. Of the various techniques, STED (stimulated emission depletion) microscopy was the first to break the diffraction barrier. Today, it is a prominent and versatile form of superresolution light microscopy. STED microscopy has shed a sharper light on numerous topics in cell biology, but also in material sciences. Both disciplines extend into the nanometer range, making detailed studies of structural and functional relationships difficult or even impossible to achieve using diffraction-limited microscopy. With recent advancements like spectral multiplexing or live-cell imaging, STED microscopy makes nanoscale materials and components of the cell accessible for fluorescence-based investigations. With multicolor superresolution imaging, even the interactions between biological and engineered nanostructures can be studied in detail. This review gives an introduction into the working principle of STED microscopy, provides a detailed overview of recent advancements and new techniques implemented for use with STED microscopy and shows how these have been applied in the life sciences and nanotechnologies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

However, these processes result in a wide range of cross-$\beta$ packing and filament arrangements, including diverse assemblies formed from identical monomeric precursors with the same amino acid sequences. Here, we review current structural and mechanistic understanding of amyloid self-assembly, and discuss how mesoscopic, i.e. micrometre to nanometre, organisation of amyloid give rise to suprastructural features that may be the key link between the polymorphic amyloid structures and the biological response they elicit. A greater understanding of the mechanisms governing suprastructure formation will guide future strategies to combat amyloid associated disorders and to use and control the amyloid quaternary structure in synthetic biology and materials applications.},

abstract = {Nanoscience and nanotechnology are closely intertwined subjects that are attracting ever-increasing attention, both in the scientific world and in the marketplace. Major developments in growth and synthesis methods mean that atoms can nowadays be manipulated in a controlled fashion to produce novel properties that are often not found in bulk materials. Techniques for locating and identifying atomic configurations within nanostructures become even more essential in the relentless drive towards realizing optimal physical behavior. In this regard, the electron microscope, with its intrinsic capacity for atomic-scale imaging and chemical analysis, has become an indispensable tool in the arsenal of the materials scientist interested in nanostructured materials. This article provides an overview of progress made towards achieving theoretical resolution limits in the electron microscope and discusses further factors that could affect the ultimate resolution attainable. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This article addresses the degree of parliamentary involvement in decisions to deploy armed forces abroad. It observes how the recourse to force by the US-led military coalition fighting against the so-called Islamic State (IS, also known as ISIL, or Da'esh) in Iraq and Syria seems to fit into a broader trend of increased parliamentary control over war-and-peace decisions on both sides of the Atlantic. Inasmuch as international legal arguments can and do play a role in parliamentary debates and concomitant resolutions, this trend carries the potential of contributing to the compliance pull of the jus ad bellum. Against this background, the article explores to what extent newfound war powers on the part of national parliaments go hand in hand with recourse to international legal arguments. The article engages this question through an analysis of the dialogue between the executive and legislative branches in a number of countries (in particular Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada) pertaining to the participation in the US-led coalition against IS.},

abstract = {Many chemical and biological systems exhibit intermittent search phenomena when participating particles alternate between dynamic regimes with different dimensionalities. Here we investigate theoretically a dynamic search process of finding a small target on a two-dimensional surface starting from a bulk solution, which is an example of such an intermittent search process. Both continuum and discrete-state stochastic descriptions are developed. It is found that depending on the scanning length $\lambda$, which describes the area visited by the reacting molecule during one search cycle, the system can exhibit three different search regimes: (i) For small $\lambda$ values, the reactant finds the target mostly via three-dimensional bulk diffusion; (ii) for large $\lambda$ values, the reactant molecule associates to the target mostly via surface diffusion; and (iii) for intermediate $\lambda$ values, the reactant reaches the target via a combination of three-dimensional and two-dimensional search cycles. Our analysis also shows that the mean search times have different scalings as a function of the size of the surface segment depending on the nature of the dynamic search regime. Search dynamics are also sensitive to the position of the target for large scanning lengths. In addition, it is argued that the continuum description underestimates mean search times and does not always correctly describe the most optimal conditions for the surface-assisted dynamic processes. The importance of our findings for real natural systems is discussed.},

Several degradation mechanisms resulting from thermal and chemical instabilities, phase transformations, exposure to visible and UV light, moisture and oxygen and most importantly sealing issues are thoroughly analyzed. Methods are suggested to study most of these degradation mechanisms in a systematic way. In addition, environmental assessment of PSCs is briefly covered. Alternative materials and their preparation methods are screened with respect to stability of the device. Overall, this work contributes in developing better understanding of the degradation mechanisms and help in improving overall stability of the PSCs.},

abstract = {Producing a definitive picture of the CO oxidation reaction (CO + O2 → CO2) on Pt-group metals (Rh, Pd, Pt, and Ru) across the 'pressure gap' has proved to be a challenging task. Surface-sensitive techniques amenable to high pressure environments (e.g. PM-IRAS) have sparked a renewed interest in this reaction under realistic pressures. Here, we review recent work in our laboratory examining CO oxidation kinetics on Pt-group single crystals using PM-IRAS, XPS, and mass spectrometry from low (10-8-10-3 Torr) to high (1-102 Torr) pressures. These studies have shown that at both low and high pressures (a) Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics adequately describe CO oxidation kinetics on Pt-group metals (Pt, Pd, Rh) (i.e. there is no pressure gap) and (b) the most active surface is one with minimal CO coverage. Additionally, recent investigations of high pressure CO oxidation kinetics on SiO2 film supported Rh particles prepared in situ are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Edgar2008,
abstract = {The poles of bacteria exhibit several specialized functions related to the mobilization of DNA and certain proteins. To monitor the infection of Escherichia coli cells by light microscopy, we developed procedures for the tagging of mature bacteriophages with quantum dots. Surprisingly, most of the infecting phages were found attached to the bacterial poles. This was true for a number of temperate and virulent phages of E. coli that use widely different receptors and for phages infecting Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Vibrio cholerae. The infecting phages colocalized with the polar protein marker IcsA-GFP. ManY, an E. coli protein that is required for phage lambda DNA injection, was found to localize to the bacterial poles as well. Furthermore, labelling of lambda DNA during infection revealed that it is injected and replicated at the polar region of infection. The evolutionary benefits that lead to this remarkable preference for polar infections may be related to lambda's developmental decision as well as to the function of poles in the ability of bacterial cells to communicate with their environment and in gene regulation.},

abstract = {X-ray lasers offer new capabilities in understanding the structure of biological systems, complex materials and matter under extreme conditions. Very short and extremely bright, coherent X-ray pulses can be used to outrun key damage processes and obtain a single diffraction pattern from a large macromolecule, a virus or a cell before the sample explodes and turns into plasma. The continuous diffraction pattern of non-crystalline objects permits oversampling and direct phase retrieval. Here we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a non-crystalline biological sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. Calculations indicate that the energy deposited into the virus by the pulse heated the particle to over 100,000K after the pulse had left the sample. The reconstructed exit wavefront (image) yielded 32-nm full-period resolution in a single exposure and showed no measurable damage. The reconstruction indicates inhomogeneous arrangement of dense material inside the virion. We expect that significantly higher resolutions will be achieved in such experiments with shorter and brighter photon pulses focused to a smaller area. The resolution in such experiments can be further extended for samples available in multiple identical copies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

Depending on the O2/CO pressure ratio, we find three well-defined structures: namely, (i) the bulk-terminated Pt(110) surface, (ii) a thin, commensurate oxide, and (iii) a thin, incommensurate oxide. The commensurate oxide only appears under reaction conditions, i.e., when both O2 and CO are present and at sufficiently high temperatures.
