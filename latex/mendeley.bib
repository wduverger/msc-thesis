abstract = {Droplet microfluidics has emerged as a powerful platform allowing a large number of individual reactions to be carried out in spatially distinct microcompartments. Due to their small size, however, the spectroscopic characterisation of species encapsulated in such systems remains challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate the acquisition of infrared spectra from single microdroplets containing aggregation-prone proteins. To this effect, droplets are generated in a microfluidic flow-focussing device and subsequently deposited in a square array onto a ZnSe prism using a micro stamp. After drying, the solutes present in the droplets are illuminated locally by an infrared laser through the prism, and their thermal expansion upon absorption of infrared radiation is measured with an atomic force microscopy tip, granting nanoscale resolution. Using this approach, we resolve structural differences in the amide bands of the spectra of monomeric and aggregated lysozyme from single microdroplets with picolitre volume. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils commonly exhibit multiple distinct morphologies in electron microscope and atomic force microscope images, often within a single image field. By using electron microscopy and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on fibrils formed by the 40-residue $\beta$-amyloid peptide of Alzheimer's disease (A$\beta$1-40), we show that different fibril morphologies have different underlying molecular structures, that the predominant structure can be controlled by subtle variations in fibril growth conditions, and that both morphology and molecular structure are self-propagating when fibrils grow from preformed seeds. Different AP 1-40 fibril morphologies also have significantly different toxicities in neuronal cell cultures. These results have implications for the mechanism of amyloid formation, the phenomenon of strains in prion diseases, the role of amyloid fibrils in amyloid diseases, and the development of amyloid-based nanomaterials.},

abstract = {The cellular polyamines spermine, spermidine, and their metabolic precursor putrescine, have long been associated with cell-growth, tumor-related gene regulations, and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we show by in vitro spectroscopy and AFM imaging, that these molecules promote aggregation of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) peptides into fibrils and modulate the aggregation pathways. NMR measurements showed that the three polyamines share a similar binding mode to monomeric A$\beta$(1-40) peptide. Kinetic ThT studies showed that already very low polyamine concentrations promote amyloid formation: addition of 10 $\mu$M spermine (normal intracellular concentration is ∼1 mM) significantly decreased the lag and transition times of the aggregation process. Spermidine and putrescine additions yielded similar but weaker effects. CD measurements demonstrated that the three polyamines induce different aggregation pathways, involving different forms of induced secondary structure. This is supported by AFM images showing that the three polyamines induce A$\beta$(1-40) aggregates with different morphologies. The results reinforce the notion that designing suitable ligands which modulate the aggregation of A$\beta$ peptides toward minimally toxic pathways may be a possible therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

The fibril consists of a single protofilament that is formed from an N-terminal and a C-terminal fragment of transthyretin. Our structure provides insights into the mechanism of misfolding and implies the formation of an early fibril state from unfolded transthyretin molecules, which upon proteolysis converts into mature ATTR amyloid fibrils.},

abstract = {Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are frequent causes of cancer. Because p53 aggregates appear in some tumor cells, it has been suggested that p53 could also cause cancer by forming self-replicating protein aggregates (prions). Here, using yeast, we show that transient p53 overexpression induced the formation of p53 prion aggregates that were transmitted for {\textgreater}100 generations, found in lysate pellets, stained with Thioflavin T, and transmitted by cytoplasmic transfer, or transfection with lysates of cells carrying the prion or with p53 amyloid peptide. As predicted for a prion, transient interruption of p53 expression caused permanent p53 prion loss. Importantly, p53 transcription factor activity was reduced by prion formation suggesting that prion aggregation could cause cancer. p53 has also been found in liquid-like nuclear droplets in animal cell culture. In yeast, we found that liquid-like p53 foci appear in response to stress and disappear with stress removal.},

abstract = {As a result of the overwhelming preoccupation with uncovering the process of radicalization into terrorist ac- tivity, little attention has been paid to the related, yet distinct processes of disengagement and deradicalization from terrorism. This continuing neglect is ironic because it may be in the analysis of disengagement that practi- cal initiatives for counterterrorism may become more apparent in their development and feasible in their execu- tion. While a variety of deradicalization initiatives worldwide are currently receiving enormous interest from afar, it is inevitable they will be subjected to intense scrutiny regarding their alleged outcomes and claimed successes. A more immediate challenge, however, is to assert some conceptual and terminological clarity. While deradicalization has become the latest buzzword in counterterrorism, it is critical that we distinguish it from disengagement and stress that not only are they different, but that just because one leaves terrorism be- hind; it rarely implies (or even necessitates) that one become ‘deradicalized'. One of several implications aris- ing from this distinction may be a more realistic appraisal of how our knowledge and understanding of the dis- engagement processes (and not undefined and poorly conceptualised deradicalization efforts) may be put to effective use in the short-medium term development of research agendas.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence has suggested that formation and propagation of misfolded aggregates of 42-residue human amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$(1-42)), rather than of the more abundant A$\beta$(1-40), provokes the Alzheimer's disease cascade. However, structural details of misfolded A$\beta$(1-42) have remained elusive. Here we present the atomic model of an A$\beta$(1-42) amyloid fibril, from solid-state NMR (ssNMR) data. It displays triple parallel-$\beta$-sheet segments that differ from reported structures of A$\beta$(1-40) fibrils. Remarkably, A$\beta$(1-40) is incompatible with the triple-$\beta$-motif, because seeding with A$\beta$(1-42) fibrils does not promote conversion of monomeric A$\beta$(1-40) into fibrils via cross-replication. ssNMR experiments suggest that C-terminal Ala42, absent in A$\beta$(1-40), forms a salt bridge with Lys28 to create a self-recognition molecular switch that excludes A$\beta$(1-40). The results provide insight into the A$\beta$(1-42)-selective self-replicating amyloid-propagation machinery in early-stage Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Loss of memory during Alzheimer's disease (AD), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder, is associated with neuronal loss and the aggregation of amyloid proteins into neurotoxic $\beta$-sheet enriched structures. However, the mechanism of amyloid protein aggregation is still not well understood due to many challenges when studying the endogenous amyloid structures in neurons or in brain tissue. Available methods either require chemical processing of the sample or may affect the amyloid protein structure itself. Therefore, new approaches, which allow studying molecular structures directly in neurons, are urgently needed. A novel approach is tested, based on label-free optical photothermal infrared super-resolution microspectroscopy, to study AD-related amyloid protein aggregation directly in the neuron at sub-micrometer resolution. Using this approach, amyloid protein aggregates are detected at the subcellular level, along the neurites and strikingly, in dendritic spines, which has not been possible until now. Here, a polymorphic nature of amyloid structures that exist in AD transgenic neurons is reported. Based on the findings of this work, it is suggested that structural polymorphism of amyloid proteins that occur already in neurons may trigger different mechanisms of AD progression.},

abstract = {Microglia, the main phagocytes of the central nervous system (CNS), are involved in the surveillance and maintenance of nervous tissue. During normal tissue homeostasis, microglia migrates within the CNS, phagocytose dead cells and tissue debris, and modulate synapse pruning and spine formation via controlled phagocytosis. In the event of an invasion by a foreign body, microglia are able to phagocytose the invading pathogen and process it proteolytically for antigen presentation. Internalized substrates are incorporated and sorted within the endocytic pathway and thereafter transported via complex vesicular routes. When targeted for degradation, substrates are delivered to acidic late endosomes and lysosomes. In these, the enzymatic degradation relies on pH and enzyme content. Endocytosis, sorting, transport, compartment acidification and degradation are regulated by complex signaling mechanisms, and these may be altered during aging and pathology. In this review, we discuss the endocytic pathway in microglia, with insight into the mechanisms controlling lysosomal biogenesis and pH regulation. We also discuss microglial lysosome function associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the mechanisms of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) internalization and degradation. Finally, we explore some therapies currently being investigated to treat AD and their effects on microglial response to A$\beta$, with insight in those involving enhancement of lysosomal function.},

Herein, we demonstrate a method for determination of donor sex, based on attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectroscopy of dry urine traces. Trace body fluid evidence is of special importance to the modern criminal investigation as a source of individualizing DNA evidence. However, individual identification of a urine donor is generally difficult because of the small amount of DNA. Therefore, the development of an innovative method to provide phenotype information about the urine donor - including sex - is highly desirable. In this study, we developed a multivariate discriminant model for the ATR FT-IR spectra of dry urine to identify the donor sex. Rigorous selection of significant wavenumbers on the spectrum using a genetic algorithm enabled superb discrimination performance for the model and conclusively indicated a chemical origin for donor sex differences, which was supported by physiological knowledge. Although further investigations need to be conducted, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates the great potential of the developed methodology for phenotype profiling based on the analysis of urine traces.},

abstract = {Infrared (IR; or mid-infrared, MIR; 4000-400 cm−1; 2500–25,000 nm) spectroscopy has become one of the most powerful and versatile tools at the disposal of modern bioscience. Because of its high molecular specificity, applicability to wide variety of samples, rapid measurement and non-invasivity, IR spectroscopy forms a potent approach to elucidate qualitative and quantitative information from various kinds of biological material. For these reasons, it became an established bioanalytical technique with diverse applications. This work aims to be a comprehensive and critical review of the recent accomplishments in the field of biomolecular and bioanalytical IR spectroscopy. That progress is presented on a wider background, with fundamental characteristics, the basic principles of the technique outlined, and its scientific capability directly compared with other methods being used in similar fields (e.g. near-infrared, Raman, fluorescence). The article aims to present a complete examination of the topic, as it touches the background phenomena, instrumentation, spectra processing and data analytical methods, spectra interpretation and related information. To suit this goal, the article includes a tutorial information essential to obtain a thorough perspective of bio-related applications of the reviewed methodologies. The importance of the fundamental factors to the final performance and applicability of IR spectroscopy in various areas of bioscience is explained. This information is interpreted in critical way, with aim to gain deep understanding why IR spectroscopy finds extraordinarily intensive use in this remarkably diverse and dynamic field of research and utility. The major focus is placed on the diversity of the applications in which IR biospectroscopy has been established so far and those onto which it is expanding nowadays. This includes qualitative and quantitative analytical spectroscopy, spectral imaging, medical diagnosis, monitoring of biophysical processes, and studies of physicochemical properties and dynamics of biomolecules. The application potential of IR spectroscopy in light of the current accomplishments and the future prospects is critically evaluated and its significance in the progress of bioscience is comprehensively presented.},

By developing a general approach that combines theory, experiment and simulation, we reveal, in molecular detail, the mechanisms of A$\beta$42 oligomer dynamics during amyloid fibril formation. Even though all mature amyloid fibrils must originate as oligomers, we found that most A$\beta$42 oligomers dissociate into their monomeric precursors without forming new fibrils. Only a minority of oligomers converts into fibrillar structures. Moreover, the heterogeneous ensemble of oligomeric species interconverts on timescales comparable to those of aggregation. Our results identify fundamentally new steps that could be targeted by therapeutic interventions designed to combat protein misfolding diseases. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

abstract = {A key part of any super-resolution technique involves accurately correcting for mechanical motion of the sample and setup during acquisition. If left uncorrected, drift degrades the resolution of the final reconstructed image and can introduce unwanted artifacts. Here, we describe how to implement active stabilization, thereby reducing drift to {\~{}}1 nm across all three dimensions. In this protocol, we show how to implement our method on custom and standard microscopy hardware. We detail the construction of a separate illumination and detection path, dedicated exclusively to acquiring the diffraction pattern of fiducials deposited on the imaging slide. We also show how to focus lock and adjust the focus in arbitrary nanometer step size increments. Our real-time focus locking is based on kHz calculations performed using the graphics processing unit. The fast calculations allow for rapid repositioning of the sample, which reduces drift below the photon-limited localization precision. Our approach allows for a single-molecule and/or super-resolution image acquisition free from movement artifacts and eliminates the need for complex algorithms or hardware installations. The method is also useful for long acquisitions which span over hours or days, such as multicolor super resolution. Installation does not require specialist knowledge and can be implemented in standard biological laboratories. The full protocol can be implemented within {\~{}}2 weeks.},

abstract = {Bacteriophage survives in at least two extremes of ionic environments: bacterial host (high ionic-cytosol) and that of soil (low ionic-environmental water). The impact of ionic composition in the micro- and macro-environments has not so far been addressed in phage biology. Here, we discovered a novel mechanism of aggregation/disaggregation transitions by phage virions. When normal sodium levels in phage media (150 mM) were lowered to 10 mM, advanced imaging by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering all revealed formation of viral packages, each containing 20–100 virions. When ionic strength was returned from low to high, the aggregated state of phage reversed to a dispersed state, and the change in ionic strength did not substantially affect infectivity of the phage. By providing the direct evidence, that lowering of the sodium ion below the threshold of 20 mM causes rapid aggregation of phage while returning Na+ concentration to the values above this threshold causes dispersion of phage, we identified a biophysical mechanism of phage aggregation. Our results implicate operation of group behavior in phage and suggest a new kind of quorum sensing among its virions that is mediated by ions. Loss of ionic strength may act as a trigger in an evolutionary mechanism to improve the survival of bacteriophage by stimulating aggregation of phage when outside a bacterial host. Reversal of phage aggregation is also a promising breakthrough in biotechnological applications, since we demonstrated here the ability to retain viable virion aggregates on standard micro-filters.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional positions of atoms in protein molecules define their structure and their roles in biological processes. The more precisely atomic coordinates are determined, the more chemical information can be derived and the more mechanistic insights into protein function may be inferred. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis has yielded protein structures with increasing levels of detail in recent years1,2. However, it has proved difficult to obtain cryo-EM reconstructions with sufficient resolution to visualize individual atoms in proteins. Here we use a new electron source, energy filter and camera to obtain a 1.7 {\AA} resolution cryo-EM reconstruction for a human membrane protein, the $\beta$3 GABAA receptor homopentamer3. Such maps allow a detailed understanding of small-molecule coordination, visualization of solvent molecules and alternative conformations for multiple amino acids, and unambiguous building of ordered acidic side chains and glycans. Applied to mouse apoferritin, our strategy led to a 1.22 {\AA} resolution reconstruction that offers a genuine atomic-resolution view of a protein molecule using single-particle cryo-EM. Moreover, the scattering potential from many hydrogen atoms can be visualized in difference maps, allowing a direct analysis of hydrogen-bonding networks. Our technological advances, combined with further approaches to accelerate data acquisition and improve sample quality, provide a route towards routine application of cryo-EM in high-throughput screening of small molecule modulators and structure-based drug discovery.},

abstract = {The amyloid-like aggregation propensity present in most globular proteins is generally considered to be a secondary side effect resulting from the requirements of protein stability. Here, we demonstrate, however, that mutations in the globular and amyloid state are thermodynamically correlated rather than simply associated. In addition, we show that the standard genetic code couples this structural correlation into a tight evolutionary relationship. We illustrate the extent of this evolutionary entanglement of amyloid propensity and globular protein stability. Suppressing a 600-Ma-conserved amyloidogenic segment in the p53 core domain fold is structurally feasible but requires 7-bp substitutions to concomitantly introduce two aggregation-suppressing and three stabilizing amino acid mutations. We speculate that, rather than being a corollary of protein evolution, it is equally plausible that positive selection for amyloid structure could have been a driver for the emergence of globular protein structure.},

@article{Merlini2003,
abstract = {AL amyloidosis results from extra-cellular deposition of fibril-forming monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains (LC) (most commonly of lambda isotype) usually secreted by a small plasma cell clone. Most patients have evidence of isolated monoclonal gammopathy or smoldering myeloma, and the occurrence of AL amyloidosis in patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma or other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders is unusual. The key event in the development of AL amyloidosis is the change in the secondary or tertiary structure of an abnormal monoclonal LC, which results in instable conformation. This conformational change is responsible for abnormal folding of the LC, rich in $\beta$ leaves, which assemble into monomers that stack together to form amyloid fibrils. AL amyloidosis is the most common type of systemic amyloidois in developed countries with an estimated incidence of 9 cases/million inhabitant/year. The average age of diagnosed patients is 65 years and less than 10{\%} of patients are under 50. The clinical presentation is protean, because of the wide number of tissues or organs that may be affected. The most common presenting symptoms are asthenia and dyspnoea, which are poorly specific and may account for delayed diagnosis. Renal manifestations are the most frequent, affecting two thirds of patients at presentation. They are characterized by heavy proteinuria, with nephrotic syndrome and impaired renal function in half of the patients. Heart involvement, which is present at diagnosis in more than 50{\%} of patients, leading to restrictive cardiopathy, is the most serious complication and engages prognosis. The diagnosis relies on pathological examination of an involved site showing Congo red-positive amyloid deposits, with typical apple-green birefringence under polarized light, that stain positive with an anti-LC antibody by immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence. Due to the systemic nature of the disease, non-invasive biopsies such as abdominal fat aspiration should be considered before taking biopsies from involved organs, in order to reduce the risk of bleeding complications. Systemic AL amyloidosis should be distinguished from other diseases related to deposition of monoclonal LC, and from other forms of systemic amyloidosis. When pathological studies have failed to identify the nature of amyloid deposits, genetic studies should be performed to diagnose hereditary amyloidosis. Treatment of AL amyloidosis is based on chemotherapy, aimed at controlling the underlying plasma clone that produces amyloidogenic LC. The hematological response should be carefully checked by serial measurements of serum free LC. The association of an alkylating agent with high-dose dexamethasone has proven to be effective in two thirds of patients and is considered as the current reference treatment. New agents used in the treatment of multiple myeloma are under investigation and appear to increase hematological response rates. Symptomatic measures and supportive care is necessary in patients with organ failure. Noticeably, usual treatments for cardiac failure (i.e. calcium inhibitors, $\beta$-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) are inefficient or even dangerous in patients with amyloid heart disease, that should be managed using diuretics. Amiodarone and pace maker implantation should be considered in patients with rhythm or conduction abnormalities. In selected cases, heart and kidney transplantation may be associated with prolonged patient and graft survival. Survival in AL amyloidosis depends on the spectrum of organ involvement (amyloid heart disease being the main prognosis factor), the severity of individual organs involved and haematological response to treatment.},

The low solubility and tendency of A$\beta$ to aggregate considerably impede the in vitro handling and biophysical or biological investigation of A$\beta$, despite the interest in this peptide because of its implication in Alzheimers disease. The main advantage of the proposed protocol over others is that it results in standardized aggregate-free A$\beta$ peptide samples that are biocompatible for cell culture studies and yield reproducible aggregation kinetics and cytotoxicities.

Here we use a recent asymptotically exact theory for the DNA extension in the "extended de Gennes regime" that allows us to compare experimental results with theory. For this purpose, we performed experiments measuring the mean DNA extension and its standard deviation while varying the channel geometry, dye intercalation ratio, and ionic strength of the buffer. The experimental results agree very well with theory at high ionic strengths, indicating that the model parameters are reliable. At low ionic strengths, the agreement is less good. We discuss possible reasons. In principle, our approach allows us to measure the Kuhn length and the effective width of a single DNA molecule and more generally of semiflexible polymers in solution.},

Less well elucidated is the role of heterotypic interactions between amyloids and other proteins and macromolecules and how this contributes to disease. We here review current data with a focus on neurodegenerative amyloid‐associated diseases. Evidence indicates that heterotypic interactions occur in a wide range of amyloid processes and that these interactions modify fundamental aspects of amyloid aggregation including seeding, aggregation rates and toxicity. More work is required to understand the mechanistic origin of these interactions, but current understanding suggests that both supersaturation and sequence‐specific binding can contribute to heterotypic amyloid interactions. Further unravelling these mechanisms may help to answer outstanding questions in the field including the selective vulnerability of cells types and tissues and the stereotypical spreading patterns of amyloids in disease.},

abstract = {The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE), sometimes referred to as the Tamil Tigers, or simply the Tigers, was a separatist militant organization based in northern Sri Lanka. It was founded in May 1976 by Prabhakaran and waged a violent secessionist and nationalist campaign to create an independent state in the north and east of Sri Lanka for the Tamil people. This campaign evolved into the Sri Lankan Civil War The Tigers were considered one of the most ruthless insurgent and terrorist organisations in the world. They were vanquished by the Sri Lankan armed forces in May 2009. In order to rehabilitate the 11,6644 Tigers who had surrendered or been taken captive, Sri Lanka developed a multifaceted program to engage and transform the violent attitudes and behaviours of the Tiger leaders, members and collaborators. Since the end of the LTTE's three-decade campaign of insurgency and terrorism, there has not been a single act of terrorism in the country. Many attribute Sri Lanka's post-conflict stability to the success of the insurgent and terrorist rehabilitation program.},

abstract = {Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) constitutes one of the most conserved and ubiquitous molecules in biology. Recent work in bacteria demonstrated that polyP increases oxidative stress resistance by preventing stress-induced protein aggregation and promotes biofilm formation by stimulating functional amyloid formation. To gain insights into these two seemingly contradictory functions of polyP, we investigated the effects of polyP on the folding model lactate dehydrogenase. We discovered that the presence of polyP during the thermal unfolding process stabilizes folding intermediates of lactate dehydrogenase as soluble micro-$\beta$-aggregates with amyloid-like properties. Size and heterogeneity of the oligomers formed in this process were dependent on the polyP chain length, with longer chains forming smaller, more homogenous complexes. This ability of polyP to stabilize thermally unfolded proteins even upon exposure to extreme temperatures appears to contribute to the observed resistance of uropathogenic Escherichia coli toward severe heat shock treatment. These results suggest that the working mechanism of polyP is the same for both soluble and amyloidogenic proteins, with the ultimate outcome likely being determined by a combination of polyP chain length and the client protein itself. They help to explain how polyP can simultaneously function as general stress-protective chaperone and instigator of amyloidogenic processes in vivo.},

@article{Ghosh2005,
abstract = {In bacteria, several physiological processes once thought to be the products of uniformly dispersed reactions are now known to be highly asymmetric, with some exhibiting interesting geometric localizations. In particular, the cell envelope of Escherichia coli displays a form of subcellular differentiation in which peptidoglycan and outer membrane proteins at the cell poles remain stable for generations while material in the lateral walls is diluted by growth and turnover. To determine if material in the side walls was organized in any way, we labeled outer membrane proteins with succinimidyl ester-linked fluorescent dyes and then grew the stained cells in the absence of dye. Labeled proteins were not evenly dispersed in the envelope but instead appeared as helical ribbons that wrapped around the outside of the cell. By staining the O8 surface antigen of E. coli 2443 with a fluorescent derivative of concanavalin A, we observed a similar helical organization for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component of the outer membrane. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicated that some of the outer membrane proteins remained freely diffusible in the side walls and could also diffuse into polar domains. On the other hand, the LPS O antigen was virtually immobile. Thus, the outer membrane of E. coli has a defined in vivo organization in which a subfraction of proteins and LPS are embedded in stable domains at the poles and along one or more helical ribbons that span the length of this gram-negative rod. The idea that bacteria might be no more than small sacks of enzymes and substrates mixed together in an amorphous jum-ble has given way to the realization that many proteins, pro-cesses, and macromolecules have geometrically diverse loca-tions and exhibit asymmetric behaviors. One example of this changing concept is that in Escherichia coli the cell poles can be considered to be distinctive organelles in which neither pepti-doglycan nor outer membrane (OM) proteins are recycled or diluted (9, 10, 12, 26). Numerous proteins or physiological complexes congregate exclusively at one or both poles, with implications for protein secretion, environmental sensing, cel-lular development, virulence, and gene transfer (14, 19, 31, 54, 55). Furthermore, one or more of these asymmetries may reg-ulate bacterial morphology because inaccurate localization of extraneous pole-like domains produces cells with aberrant shapes (12, 44). Another surprising facet of prokaryotic structure is that sev-eral proteins assemble in long filaments that spiral across the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane, reaching from one end of the cell to the other. The MreB and Mbl proteins form such fibrils, or cables, in Bacillus subtilis (22) and Caulobacter crescentus (17) and may serve as internal scaffolds that position peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes, thereby defining the shape of the cell wall (17, 29, 33). The MinCD proteins oscil-late from pole to pole along helical paths, inhibiting polymer-ization of the principal cell division protein FtsZ and helping to define the cell's center (56). FtsZ itself moves from completed septa to new division sites by traveling along helical pathways on the inner membrane (1, 58), and even nonassembled FtsZ monomers oscillate back and forth along helical tracks (60). DNA dispersal at cell division also relies on proteins with helical distributions: the SetB protein is required for proper chromosomal segregation in E. coli (16), and the ParA protein moves along spiral-shaped threads to segregate R1 plasmids (13). And finally, the SecA and SecY secretion complexes are distributed in helical fashion in the inner membrane of B. subtilis (4), although this may not be true in E. coli (3). Except for the Sec proteins, the other spiraling proteins seem to share the common function of partitioning some substance—shape elements (MreB and Mbl), cell volume (MinCD and FtsZ), or DNA (SetB and ParA)—so that the materials are distributed uniformly to daughter cells after division. One question that arises is whether one of the above pro-teins creates the principal scaffold on which the others assem-ble or travel, or if there is an underlying helical structure in which proteins move independently. A recent observation hints at the importance of the latter possibility. Gibbs et al. found that in E. coli newly synthesized LamB protein diffuses throughout the OM in a helical fashion (20). This behavior implies the existence of long-lived spiral boundaries that re-strict the diffusion of LamB, and perhaps other surface pro-teins, to defined OM " canals. " However, the OM has been considered to be continuous and homogeneous, and no obvi-ous structure has been observed that might serve such a pur-pose. On the other hand, polar domains constitute an excep-tion to the idea of the uniformity of the OM (9, 12). Since an unknown mechanism maintains this distinction between the poles and the cell cylinder, another overlooked structure(s) may exist in the cell envelope as well. In this work we ask whether components of the OM have},

The importance of characterizing their aggregation has steadily increased because of their link to human diseases and material science applications. In particular, misfolding and aggregation of the Josephin domain of ataxin-3 is implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia-3. Infrared nanospectroscopy, simultaneously exploiting atomic force microscopy and infrared spectroscopy, can characterize at the nanoscale the conformational rearrangements of proteins during their aggregation. Here we demonstrate that we can individually characterize the oligomeric and fibrillar species formed along the amyloid aggregation. We describe their secondary structure, monitoring at the nanoscale an $\alpha$-to-$\beta$ transition, and couple these studies with an independent measurement of the evolution of their intrinsic stiffness. These results suggest that the aggregation of Josephin proceeds from the monomer state to the formation of spheroidal intermediates with a native structure. Only successively, these intermediates evolve into misfolded aggregates and into the final fibrils.},

abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most dangerous type of DNA damage because they can result in the loss of large chromosomal regions. In all mammalian cells, DSBs that occur throughout the cell cycle are repaired predominantly by the non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Defects in NHEJ result in sensitivity to ionizing radiation and the ablation of lymphocytes. The NHEJ pathway utilizes proteins that recognize, resect, polymerize and ligate the DNA ends in a flexible manner. This flexibility permits NHEJ to function on a wide range of DNA-end configurations, with the resulting repaired DNA junctions often containing mutations. In this Review, we discuss the most recent findings regarding the relative involvement of the different NHEJ proteins in the repair of various DNA-end configurations. We also discuss the shunting of DNA-end repair to the auxiliary pathways of alternative end joining (a-EJ) or single-strand annealing (SSA) and the relevance of these different pathways to human disease.},

Here, the former is addressed a posteriori. The specific challenges associated with improving the electrical power conversion efficiency of various nano-PV technologies are discussed and several approaches to reduce their thermal losses beyond the single bandgap limit are reviewed. Critical considerations related to the module lifetime and cost that are unique to nano-PV architectures are also addressed. The analysis suggests that a practical single-junction laboratory power conversion efficiency limit of 17{\%} and a two-cell tandem power conversion efficiency limit of 24{\%} are possible for nano-PVs, which, when combined with operating lifetimes of 10 to 15 years, could position them as a transformational technology for solar energy markets.},

Here we analyzed the mechanisms of indole production in Fusobacterium nucleatum and the effects of tryptophan and indole on F. nucleatum planktonic and biofilm cells. The amino acid sequence deduced from the fn1943 gene in F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 was 28{\%} identical to that deduced from tnaA in Escherichia coli, which encodes tryptophanase catalyzing the beta-elimination of l-tryptophan to produce indole. The fn1943 gene was cotranscribed with the downstream gene fn1944, which is a homolog of tnaB encoding low-affinity tryptophan permease. The transcript started at position -68 or -153 from the first nucleotide of the fn1943 translation initiation codon. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that much more F. nucleatum fn1943 transcripts were obtained from log-phase cells than from stationary-phase cells. Indole production by the purified recombinant protein encoded by fn1943 was examined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The K(m) and k(cat) of the enzyme were 0.26 +/- 0.03 mM and 0.74 +/- 0.04 s(-1), respectively. F. nucleatum biofilm formation and the biofilm supernatant concentration of indole increased dose dependently with increasing tryptophan concentrations. Exogenous indole also increased F. nucleatum biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. Even at very high concentrations, tryptophan did not affect fn1943 expression, whereas similar indole concentrations decreased expression. Thus, exogenous tryptophan and indole were suggested to increase F. nucleatum biofilms.},

The PCE was doubled after 2 years by optimizing the perovskite coating conditions. However, the liquid-based perovskite solar cell receives little attention because of its stability issues, including instant dissolution of the perovskite in a liquid electrolyte. A long-term, stable, and high efficiency (∼10{\%}) perovskite solar cell was developed in 2012 by substituting the solid hole conductor with a liquid electrolyte. Efficiencies have quickly risen to 18{\%} in just 2 years.

Strikingly, unlike computational predictors and previous measurements, the empirical nucleation scores accurately identify all known dominant fAD mutations in AB42, genetically validating that the mechanism of nucleation in a cell-based assay is likely to be very similar to the mechanism that causes the human disease. These results provide the first comprehensive atlas of how mutations alter the formation of any amyloid fibril and a resource for the interpretation of genetic variation in A$\beta$.},

In the present work we used in vivo multiphoton microscopy (MPM) to demonstrate that curcumin crosses the blood-brain barrier and labels senile plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Moreover, systemic treatment of mice with curcumin for 7 days clears and reduces existing plaques, as monitored with longitudinal imaging, suggesting a potent disaggregation effect. Curcumin also led to a limited, but significant reversal of structural changes in dystrophic dendrites, including abnormal curvature and dystrophy size. Together, these data suggest that curcumin reverses existing amyloid pathology and associated neurotoxicity in a mouse model of AD. This approach could lead to more effective clinical therapies for the prevention of oxidative stress, inflammation and neurotoxicity associated with AD. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {The accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates represents a universal hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate protein structure and function. Dysregulated PTMs may influence the propensity for protein aggregation in NDD-proteinopathies. To investigate this, we systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate effects of PTMs on aggregation propensity for major proteins linked to the pathogenesis and/or progression of NDDs. A search of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science Core Collection was conducted to retrieve studies that investigated an association between PTMs and protein aggregation in seven NDDs: Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinocerebellar ataxias, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, and multiple sclerosis. Together, 1222 studies were identified, of which 69 met eligibility criteria. We identified that the following PTMs, in isolation or combination, potentially act as modulators of proteinopathy in NDDs: Isoaspartate formation in A$\beta$, phosphorylation of A$\beta$ or tau in AD; acetylation, 4-hydroxy-2-neonal modification, OGlcNAcylation or phosphorylation of $\alpha$-synuclein in PD; acetylation or phosphorylation of TAR DNA-binding protein-43 in ALS, and SUMOylation of superoxide dismutase-1 in ALS; and phosphorylation of huntingtin in HD. The potential pharmacological manipulation of these aggregation-modulating PTMs represents an as-yet untapped source of therapy to treat NDDs.},

One Yop, YopO, also known as YpkA, induces actin-filament disruption, impairing phagocytosis. Here we describe the X-ray structure of Yersinia enterocolitica YopO in complex with actin, which reveals that YopO binds to an actin monomer in a manner that blocks polymerization yet allows the bound actin to interact with host actin-regulating proteins. SILAC-MS and biochemical analyses confirm that actin-polymerization regulators such as VASP, EVL, WASP, gelsolin and the formin diaphanous 1 are directly sequestered and phosphorylated by YopO through formation of ternary complexes with actin. This leads to a model in which YopO at the membrane sequesters actin from polymerization while using the bound actin as bait to recruit, phosphorylate and misregulate host actin-regulating proteins to disrupt phagocytosis.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils have recently received attention due to their remarkable mechanical properties, which are highly correlated with their biological functions. We have studied the mechanical deformation mechanisms and properties of amyloid fibrils as a function of their length scales by using atomistic simulations. It is shown that the length of amyloid fibrils plays a role in their deformation and fracture mechanisms in such a way that the competition between shear and bending deformations is highly dependent on the fibril length, and that as the fibril length increases, so does the bending strength of the fibril while its shear strength decreases. The dependence of rupture force for amyloid fibrils on their length is elucidated using the Bell model, which suggests that the rupture force of the fibril is determined from the hydrogen bond rupture mechanism that critically depends on the fibril length. We have measured the toughness of amyloid fibrils, which is shown to depend on the fibril length. In particular, the toughness of the fibril with its length of ∼3 nm is estimated to be ∼30 kcal mol-1 nm-3, comparable to that of a spider silk crystal with its length of ∼2 nm. Moreover, we have shown the important effect of the pulling rate on the mechanical deformation mechanisms and properties of amyloid fibril. It is found that as the pulling rate increases, so does the contribution of the shear effect to the elastic deformation of the amyloid fibril with its length of {\textless}10 nm. However, we found that the deformation mechanism of the amyloid fibril with its length of {\textgreater}15 nm is almost independent of the pulling rate. Our study sheds light on the role of the length scale of amyloid fibrils and the pulling rate in their mechanical behaviors and properties, which may provide insights into how the excellent mechanical properties of protein fibrils can be determined.},

abstract = {The tumor microenvironment contributes to cancer progression, in part through interactions between tumor and normal stromal cells. This study analyzed morphological and molecular changes induced in co-cultured human fibroblasts (HFs) and the MG-63 osteosarcoma cell line. Co-cultured cell monolayers were morphologically analyzed using high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), and trans-well assays were performed to assess cell migration and invasion. Proteins involved in inflammatory responses, cancer cell invasion, and angiogenesis were assessed using western blotting. HR-SEM showed progressive spatial orientation loss by fibroblasts in contact with MG-63s, while MG-63s proliferated rapidly and invaded HF space. Trans-well assays showed enhanced MG-63 migration in the presence of HFs. IL-6 expression was increased in co-cultured HFs, possibly stimulated by TNF-$\alpha$. HFs do not normally express YKL-40 but did so in co-culture. Band densitometric analyses showed that increasing YKL-40 expression was followed by VEGF overexpression, especially in MG-63s. Finally, our results confirmed fibroblasts as the main matrix metalloproteinase source in this tumor microenvironment. Our study sheds new light on how tumor-stroma interactions promote tumor development and progression, and may support identification of novel anti-cancer therapeutics.},

The field is at a cross-roads about whether to continue anti-A$\beta$ therapy or more actively pursue alternative targets.

abstract = {The transcriptional regulator p53 has an essential role in tumor suppression. Almost 50{\%} of human cancers are associated with the loss of p53 functions, where p53 often accumulates in the nucleus as well as in cytoplasm. Although it has been previously suggested that amyloid formation could be a cause of p53 loss-of-function in subset of tumors, the characterization of these amyloids and its structure-function relationship is not yet established. In the current study, we provide several evidences for the presence of p53 amyloid formation (in human and animal cancer tissues); along with its isolation from human cancer tissues and the biophysical characterization of these tissue-derived fibrils. Using amyloid seed of p53 fragment (P8, p53(250-257)), we show that p53 amyloid formation in cells not only leads to its functional inactivation but also transforms it into an oncoprotein. The in vitro studies further show that cancer-associated mutation destabilizes the fold of p53 core domain and also accelerates the aggregation and amyloid formation by this protein. Furthermore, we also show evidence of prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of different p53 amyloid species including full-length p53, which is induced by internalized P8 fibrils. The present study suggests that p53 amyloid formation could be one of the possible cause of p53 loss of function and therefore, inhibiting p53 amyloidogenesis could restore p53 tumor suppressor functions.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration associated with amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptide aggregation. The aggregation of A$\beta$ monomers (A$\beta$Ms) leads to the formation of A$\beta$ oligomers (A$\beta$Os), the neurotoxic A$\beta$ form, capable of permeating the cell membrane. Here, we investigated the effect of a fluorene-based active drug candidate, named K162, on both A$\beta$ aggregation and A$\beta$O toxicity toward the bilayer lipid membrane (BLM). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and molecular dynamics (MD) were employed to show that K162 inhibits A$\beta$Os-induced BLM permeation, thus preserving BLM integrity. In the presence of K162, only shallow defects on the BLM surface were formed. Apparently, K162 modifies A$\beta$ aggregation by bypassing the formation of toxic A$\beta$Os, and only nontoxic A$\beta$Ms, dimers (A$\beta$Ds), and fibrils (A$\beta$Fs) are produced. Unlike other A$\beta$ toxicity inhibitors, K162 preserves neurologically beneficial A$\beta$Ms. This unique K162 inhibition mechanism provides an alternative AD therapeutic strategy that could be explored in the future.},

Detailed information regarding amyloid fibrils' assembly mechanism, functional properties, disease association, and nano-mechanical characteristics can be gained from studies of their length distribution. Such statistical characterization of fibril length will contribute to the future development of improved therapies targeting amyloid-associated disease and novel amyloid-based nano-materials. Nano-scale microscopy visualization of amyloid fibrils allows direct measurement of the length of individual fibril particles deposited on the surface of substrates. However, quantitative characterization of the detailed length distributions of amyloid fibrils in bulk samples is far from straightforward. In this chapter, I describe a method, based on the analysis of atomic force microscopy images, which enables the quantitative characterization of amyloid fibril length distributions in bulk fibril samples. This is illustrated by using amyloid fibril samples generated in vitro from $\beta$2-microglobulin. I discuss the practical considerations in determining fibril length distribution, including sample preparation, image acquisition, fibril tracing, length-dependent bias correction, and distribution analysis. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It is a pair of $\beta$-sheets, with the facing side chains of the two sheets interdigitated in a dry 'steric zipper'. Here we report some 30 other segments from fibril-forming proteins that form amyloid-like fibrils, microcrystals, or usually both. These include segments from the Alzheimer's amyloid-$\beta$ and tau proteins, the PrP prion protein, insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), lysozyme, myoglobin, $\alpha$-synuclein and $\beta$2-microglobulin, suggesting that common structural features are shared by amyloid diseases at the molecular level.

abstract = {Evidence linking amyloid beta (A$\beta$) cellular uptake and toxicity has burgeoned, and mechanisms underlying this association are subjects of active research. Two major, interconnected questions are whether A$\beta$ uptake is aggregation-dependent and whether it is sequence-specific. We recently reported that the neuronal uptake of A$\beta$ depends significantly on peptide chirality, suggesting that the process is predominantly receptor-mediated. Over the past decade, the cellular prion protein (PrPC) has emerged as an important mediator of A$\beta$-induced toxicity and of neuronal A$\beta$ internalization. Here, we report that the soluble, nonfibrillizing A$\beta$ (1–30) peptide recapitulates full-length A$\beta$ stereoselective cellular uptake, allowing us to decouple aggregation from cellular, receptor-mediated internalization. Moreover, we found that A$\beta$ (1–30) uptake is also dependent on PrPC expression. NMR-based molecular-level characterization identified the docking site on PrPC that underlies the stereoselective binding of A$\beta$ (1–30). Our findings therefore identify a specific sequence within A$\beta$ that is responsible for the recognition of the peptide by PrPC, as well as PrPC-dependent cellular uptake. Further uptake stereodifferentiation in PrPC-free cells points toward additional receptor-mediated interactions as likely contributors for A$\beta$ cellular internalization. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of targeting cellular surface receptors to inhibit A$\beta$ cellular uptake as an alternative route for future therapeutic development for Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {The oligomers formed during the early steps of amyloid aggregation are thought to be responsible for the neurotoxic damage associated with Alzheimer's disease. It is therefore of great interest to characterize this early aggregation process and the aggregates formed, especially for the most significant peptide in amyloid fibrils, Amyloid-$\beta$(1-42) (A$\beta$42). For this purpose, we directly monitored the changes in size and concentration of initially monomeric A$\beta$42 samples, using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy. We found that A$\beta$42 undergoes aggregation only when the amount of amyloid monomers exceeds the critical aggregation concentration (cac) of about 90 nM. This spontaneous, cooperative process resembles surfactants self-Assembly and yields stable micellelike oligomers whose size (≈50 monomers, Rh ≈ 7-11 nm) and elongated shape are independent of incubation time and peptide concentration. These findings reveal essential features of in vitro amyloid aggregation, which may illuminate the complex in vivo process.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibril formation is associated with misfolding diseases, as well as fulfilling a functional role. The cross-$\beta$ molecular architecture has been reported in increasing numbers of amyloidlike fibrillar systems. The Waltz algorithm is able to predict ordered self-assembly of amyloidogenic peptides by taking into account the residue type and position. This algorithm has expanded the amyloid sequence space, and in the present study we characterize the structures of amyloid-like fibrils formed by three peptides identified by Waltz that form fibrils but not crystals. The structural challenge is met by combining electron microscopy, linear dichroism, CD and X-ray fibre diffraction. We propose structures that reveal a cross-$\beta$ conformation with 'steric-zipper' features, giving insights into the role for side chains in peptide packing and stability within fibrils. The amenity of these peptides to structural characterization makes them compelling model systems to use for understanding the relationship between sequence, self-assembly, stability and structure of amyloid fibrils. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biochemical Society.},

In this report, we show that RIG-I is a novel target of the YopT protein. Remarkably, YopT interacts with RIG-I and inhibits rat liver homogenate-mediated nuclear factor-$\kappa$B and interferon regulatory factor-3 activation.

Here we show, using TIRF-SIM to examine the organization of microclusters at sub-diffraction resolution, the presence of two spatially distinct domains composed of ZAP70-bound TCR and LAT-associated signaling complex. Kinetic analysis of microcluster assembly reveal surprising delays between the stepwise recruitment of ZAP70 and signaling proteins to the TCR, as well as distinct patterns in their disassociation. These delays are regulated by intracellular calcium flux downstream of T cell activation.

abstract = {In the developing cortex, projection neurons undergo multipolar-bipolar transition, radial-directed migration, and maturation. The contribution of these developmental steps to the structure of the adult cortex is not completely understood. Here, we report that huntingtin (HTT), the protein mutated in Huntington's disease, is enriched in polarizing projection neurons. The depletion of HTT in postmitotic projection neurons leads to the mislocalization of layer-specific neuronal populations in the mouse neocortex. HTT is required for the multipolar-bipolar transition of projection neurons and for the maintenance of their bipolar shape during their radial migration. HTT mediates these effects in vivo through the regulation of RAB11-dependent N-Cadherin trafficking. Importantly, HD pathological HTT alters RAB11-dependent neuronal migration. Finally, we show that the cortical defects resulting from the postmitotic loss of HTT specifically during embryonic development affect neuronal morphology at adulthood. Our data reveal a new HTT-RAB11-N-Cadherin pathway regulating multipolar-bipolar transition with direct implications for mature brain. Video Abstract},

In terms of "Pros," for example, phages can be bactericidal, can increase in number over the course of treatment, tend to only minimally disrupt normal flora, are equally effective against antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, often are easily discovered, seem to be capable of disrupting bacterial biofilms, and can have low inherent toxicities. In addition to these assets, we consider aspects of phage therapy that can contribute to its safety, economics, or convenience, but in ways that are perhaps less essential to the phage potential to combat bacteria. For example, autonomous phage transfer between animals during veterinary application could provide convenience or economic advantages by decreasing the need for repeated phage application, but is not necessarily crucial to therapeutic success. We also consider possible disadvantages to phage use as antibacterial agents. These "Cons," however, tend to be relatively minor.},

We find that target-activated, nonspecific single-stranded deoxyribonuclease (ssDNase) cleavage is also a property of other type V CRISPR-Cas12 enzymes.

abstract = {The endothelium provides a strong barrier separating circulating blood from tissue. It also provides a significant challenge for immune cells in the bloodstream to access potential sites of infection. To mount an effective immune response, leukocytes traverse the endothelial layer in a process known as transendothelial migration. Decades of work have allowed dissection of the mechanisms through which immune cells gain access into peripheral tissues, and subsequently to inflammatory foci. However, an often under-appreciated or potentially ignored question is whether transmigrated leukocytes can leave these inflammatory sites, and perhaps even return across the endothelium and re-enter circulation. Although evidence has existed to support “reverse” transendothelial migration for a number of years, it is only recently that mechanisms associated with this process have been described. Here we review the evidence that supports both reverse transendothelial migration and reverse interstitial migration within tissues, with particular emphasis on some of the more recent studies that finally hint at potential mechanisms. Additionally, we postulate the biological significance of retrograde migration, and whether it serves as an additional mechanism to limit pathology, or provides a basis for the dissemination of systemic inflammation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Chemical Society. Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) are crystals with the structural formula ABX 3 , where A, B, and X are organic and inorganic ions, respectively. While known for several decades, HOIPs have only in recent years emerged as extremely promising semiconducting materials for solar energy applications. In particular, power-conversion efficiencies of HOIP-based solar cells have improved at a record speed and, after only little more than 6 years of photovoltaics research, surpassed the 20{\%} threshold, which is an outstanding result for a solution-processable material. It is thus of fundamental importance to reveal physical and chemical phenomena that contribute to, or limit, these impressive photovoltaic efficiencies.To understand charge-transport and light-absorption properties of semiconducting materials, one often invokes a lattice of ions displaced from their static positions only by harmonic vibrations. However, a preponderance of recent studies suggests that this picture is not sufficient for HOIPs, where a variety of structurally dynamic effects, beyond small harmonic vibrations, arises already at room temperature.In this Account, we focus on these effects. First, we review structure and bonding in HOIPs and relate them to the promising charge-transport and absorption properties of these materials, in terms of favorable electronic properties. We point out that HOIPs are much "softer" mechanically, compared to other efficient solar-cell materials, and that this can result in large ionic displacements at room temperature. We therefore focus next on dynamic structural effects in HOIPs, going beyond a static band-structure picture. Specifically, we discuss pertinent experimental and theoretical findings as to phase-transition behavior and molecular/octahedral rearrangements. We then discuss atomic diffusion phenomena in HOIPs, with an emphasis on the migration of intrinsic and extrinsic ionic species. From this combined perspective, HOIPs appear as highly dynamic materials, in which structural fluctuations and long-range ionic motion have an unusually strong impact on charge-transport and optical properties. We highlight the potential implications of these effects for several intriguing phenomenological observations, ranging from scattering mechanisms and lifetimes of charge carriers to light-induced structural effects and ionic conduction.

abstract = {The linear response theory has given a general proof of the fluctuation- dissipation theorem which states that the linear response of a given system to an external perturbation is expressed in terms of fluctuation properties of the system in thermal equilibrium. This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed. 1.},

True prions stably maintain unique conformations ("strains") invivo that link structure topatterns of pathology. We now find that tau meets this criterion. Stably expressed tau repeat domain indefinitely propagates distinct amyloid conformations in a clonal fashion in culture. Reintroduction of tau from these lines into naive cells reestablishes identical clones. We produced two strains invitro that induce distinct pathologies invivo as determined by successive inoculations into three generations of transgenic mice. Immunopurified tau from these mice recreates the original strains in culture. We used the cell system to isolate tau strains from 29 patients with 5 different tauopathies, finding that different diseases are associated with different sets of strains. Tau thus demonstrates essential characteristics of a prion. This might explain the phenotypic diversity of tauopathies and could enable more effective diagnosis and therapy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A central hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques chiefly consisting of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptides in the brain interstitium. A$\beta$ largely exists in two isoforms, 40 and 42 amino acids long, but a large body of evidence points to A$\beta$(1-42) rather than A$\beta$(1-40) as the cytotoxic form. One proposed mechanism by which A$\beta$ exerts toxicity is the formation of ion channel pores that disrupt intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. However, previous studies using membrane mimetics have not identified any notable difference in the channel forming properties between A$\beta$(1-40) and A$\beta$(1-42). Here, we tested whether a more physiological environment, membranes excised from HEK293 cells of neuronal origin, would reveal differences in the relative channel forming ability of monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar forms of both A$\beta$(1-40) and A$\beta$(1-42). A$\beta$ preparations were characterized with transmission electron microscopy and thioflavin T fluorescence. A$\beta$ was then exposed to the extracellular face of excised membranes, and transmembrane currents were monitored using patch clamp. Our data indicated that A$\beta$(1-42) assemblies in oligomeric preparations form voltage-independent, non-selective ion channels. In contrast, A$\beta$(1-40) oligomers, fibers, and monomers did not form channels. Ion channel conductance results suggested that A$\beta$(1-42) oligomers, but not monomers and fibers, formed three distinct pore structures with 1.7-, 2.1-, and 2.4-nm pore diameters. Our findings demonstrate that only A$\beta$(1-42) contains unique structural features that facilitate membrane insertion and channel formation, now aligning ion channel formation with the differential neurotoxic effect of A$\beta$(1-40) and A$\beta$(1-42) in Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Conventional asymmetric PCR is inefficient and difficult to optimize because limiting the concentration of one primer lowers its melting temperature below the reaction annealing temperature. Linear-After-The-Exponential (LATE)-PCR describes a new paradigm for primer design that renders assays as efficient as symmetric PCR assays, regardless of primer ratio. LATE-PCR generates single-stranded products with predictable kinetics for many cycles beyond the exponential phase. LATE-PCR also introduces new probe design criteria that uncouple hybridization probe detection from primer annealing and extension, increase probe reliability, improve allele discrimination, and increase signal strength by 80-250{\%} relative to symmetric PCR. These improvements in PCR are particularly useful for real-time quantitative analysis of target numbers in small samples. LATE-PCR is adaptable to high throughput applications in fields such as clinical diagnostics, biodefense, forensics, and DNA sequencing. We showcase LATE-PCR via amplification of the cystic fibrosis CFDelta508 allele and the Tay-Sachs disease TSD 1278 allele from single heterozygous cells.},

abstract = {We report solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements that probe the supramolecular organization of $\beta$-sheets in the cross-$\beta$ motif of amyloid fibrils formed by residues 11-25 of the $\beta$-amyloid peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease (A$\beta$11-25). Fibrils were prepared at pH 7.4 and pH 2.4. The solid state NMR data indicate that the central hydrophobic segment of A$\beta$11-25 (sequence LVFFA) adopts a $\beta$-strand conformation and participates in antiparallel $\beta$-sheets at both pH values, but that the registry of intermolecular hydrogen bonds is pH-dependent. Moreover, both registries determined for A$\beta$11-25 fibrils are different from the hydrogen bond registry in the antiparallel $\beta$-sheets of A$\beta$16-22 fibrils at pH 7.4 determined in earlier solid state NMR studies. In all three cases, the hydrogen bond registry is highly ordered, with no detectable "registry-shift" defects. These results suggest that the supramolecular organization of $\beta$-sheets in amyloid fibrils is determined by a sensitive balance of multiple side-chain-side-chain interactions. Recent structural models for A$\beta$ 11-25 fibrils based on X-ray fiber diffraction data are inconsistent with the solid state NMR data at both pH values. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: Micrometer resolution placement and immobilization of probe molecules is an important step in the preparation of biochips and a wide range of lab-on-chip systems. Most known methods for such a deposition of several different substances are costly and only suitable for a limited number of probes. In this article we present a flexible procedure for simultaneous spatially controlled immobilization of functional biomolecules by molecular ink lithography.Results: For the bottom-up fabrication of surface bound nanostructures a universal method is presented that allows the immobilization of different types of biomolecules with micrometer resolution. A supporting surface is biotinylated and streptavidin molecules are deposited with an AFM (atomic force microscope) tip at distinct positions. Subsequent incubation with a biotinylated molecule species leads to binding only at these positions. After washing streptavidin is deposited a second time with the same AFM tip and then a second biotinylated molecule species is coupled by incubation. This procedure can be repeated several times. Here we show how to immobilize different types of biomolecules in an arbitrary arrangement whereas most common methods can deposit only one type of molecules. The presented method works on transparent as well as on opaque substrates. The spatial resolution is better than 400 nm and is limited only by the AFM's positional accuracy after repeated z-cycles since all steps are performed in situ without moving the supporting surface. The principle is demonstrated by hybridization to different immobilized DNA oligomers and was validated by fluorescence microscopy.Conclusions: The immobilization of different types of biomolecules in high-density microarrays is a challenging task for biotechnology. The method presented here not only allows for the deposition of DNA at submicrometer resolution but also for proteins and other molecules of biological relevance that can be coupled to biotin. {\textcopyright} 2010 Breitenstein et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

These characteristics can affect a specific phage's binding capabilities and the susceptibility of the host cell to phage attack. Despite the complexity of this process, describing adsorption kinetics of a population of bacteriophages binding to a culture of cells has been accomplished with relatively simple equations governed by the laws of mass-action. Many permutations and modifications to the basic set of reactions have been suggested through the years.

abstract = { Prions of lower eukaryotes are transmissible protein particles that propagate by converting homotypic soluble proteins into growing protein assemblies. Prion activity is conferred by so-called prion domains, regions of low complexity that are often enriched in glutamines and asparagines (Q/N). The compositional similarity of fungal prion domains with intrinsically disordered domains found in many mammalian proteins raises the question of whether similar sequence elements can drive prion-like phenomena in mammals. Here, we define sequence features of the prototype Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sup35 prion domain that govern prion activities in mammalian cells by testing the ability of deletion mutants to assemble into self-perpetuating particles. Interestingly, the amino-terminal Q/N-rich tract crucially important for prion induction in yeast was dispensable for the prion life cycle in mammalian cells. Spontaneous and template-assisted prion induction, growth, and maintenance were preferentially driven by the carboxy-terminal region of the prion domain that contains a putative soft amyloid stretch recently proposed to act as a nucleation site for prion assembly. Our data demonstrate that preferred prion nucleation domains can differ between lower and higher eukaryotes, resulting in the formation of prions with strikingly different amyloid cores. },

Both the interdisciplinary nature of the work and industry trends necessitate that professionals from different functions work together on development projects to create the highest-quality product in the shortest time. Understanding the conditions that facilitate teamwork has been a pursuit of researchers for nearly a half century. The present paper reviews existing literature on teams and team learning in organizational behavior and technology and innovation to offer insights for research on NPD teams. Building on prior work, the organizational benefits of NPD teams are summarized, and five attributes of these teams are identified that hinder attainment of their potential: (1) project complexity; (2) cross-functionality; (3) temporary membership; (4) fluid team boundaries; and (5) embeddedness in organizational structures. It is argued here that effective management of these five attributes allows not only organization-level benefits but also team-level benefits in the form of new capabilities and team member resilience. The critical roles of leadership and of communication and conflict management training are then highlighted as strategies for overcoming the challenges to team effectiveness in NPD as well as for realizing five team benefits: (1) project management skills; (2) broad perspective; (3) teaming skills; (4) expanded social network; and (5) boundary-spanning skills. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these ideas for conducting future team research. {\textcopyright} 2009 Product Development {\&} Management Association.},

abstract = {Atomic force microscopy, AFM, is a powerful tool that can produce detailed topographical images of individual nano-structures with a high signal-to-noise ratio without the need for ensemble averaging. However, the application of AFM in structural biology has been hampered by the tip-sample convolution effect, which distorts images of nano-structures, particularly those that are of similar dimensions to the cantilever probe tips used in AFM. Here we show that the tip-sample convolution results in a feature-dependent and non-uniform distribution of image resolution on AFM topographs. We show how this effect can be utilised in structural studies of nano-sized upward convex objects such as spherical or filamentous molecular assemblies deposited on a flat surface, because it causes 'magnification' of such objects in AFM topographs. Subsequently, this enhancement effect is harnessed through contact-point based deconvolution of AFM topographs. Here, the application of this approach is demonstrated through the 3D reconstruction of the surface envelope of individual helical amyloid filaments without the need of cross-particle averaging using the contact-deconvoluted AFM topographs. Resolving the structural variations of individual macromolecular assemblies within inherently heterogeneous populations is paramount for mechanistic understanding of many biological phenomena such as amyloid toxicity and prion strains. The approach presented here will also facilitate the use of AFM for high-resolution structural studies and integrative structural biology analysis of single molecular assemblies.},

abstract = {Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) reveals unique and promising redox properties, making RuO2 a potential candidate for a versatile oxidation catalyst. Recently Zhang and Kisch reported, for instance, that RuO2 is a robust and efficient catalyst for room temperature (RT) oxidation of CO by humid air; recall that typical metal oxides do not tolerate humidity. In this contribution we present scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data which directly image the catalytically important processes occurring on the RuO2(110) surface after exposing the pristine surface to CO and O2. These data are complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe following processes are governing the catalytic activity of RuO2 on atomic scale. The reactants from the gas phase encounter strongly binding adsorption sites on the RuO2(110) surface in the form of the under-coordinated Ru atoms. For instance, CO adsorbs on the stoichiometric RuO2(110) surface by 1.2 eV (over the 1f-cus-Ru), while on the reduced RuO2(110) surface the CO binding energies are 1.61 eV and 1.85 eV for adsorption over 1f-cus-Ru and 2f-cus-Ru atoms, respectively. The RuO2 surface provides an active oxygen species to react with CO, i.e. the under-coordinated (bridging) lattice oxygen atoms Obr. The recombination of adsorbed CO with Obr creates vacancies, which are identified with STM. At RT, oxygen molecules from the gas phase can efficiently dissociate on RuO2(110) via the molecular precursor state. This leads to weakly held O atoms, which are grouped in pairs as imaged with STM. It is argued that the weakly held oxygen plays an important role in replenishing the consumed (bridging) lattice oxygen atoms on the (partially) reduced RuO2(110) surface.},

abstract = {For phytoplankton and other microbes, nutrient receptors are often the passages through which viruses invade. This presents a bottom-up vs. top-down, co-limitation scenario; how do these would-be-hosts balance minimizing viral susceptibility with maximizing uptake of limiting nutrient(s)? This question has been addressed in the biological literature on evolutionary timescales for populations, but a shorter timescale, mechanistic perspective is lacking, and marine viral literature suggests the strong influence of additional factors, e.g. host size; while the literature on both nutrient uptake and host-virus interactions is expansive, their intersection, of ubiquitous relevance to marine environments, is understudied. I present a simple, mechanistic model from first principles to analyze the effect of this co-limitation scenario on individual growth, which suggests that in environments with high risk of viral invasion or spatial/temporal heterogeneity, an individual host's growth rate may be optimized with respect to receptor coverage, producing top-down selective pressure on short timescales. The model has general applicability, is suggestive of hypotheses for empirical exploration, and can be extended to theoretical studies of more complex behaviors and systems.},

abstract = {Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is an anionic surfactant that can be used to stimulate protein fibrillation in vitro. Here, we investigated the effects of SDS on camel IgG aggregation at pH 3.5 and 7.4. SDS-induced amyloid fibril formation in camel IgG was examined by turbidity measurements, Rayleigh scattering, Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, intrinsic fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results suggest that low SDS concentrations (0.2–2.0 mM) induce amyloid-like aggregates of camel IgG at pH 3.5, indicating an SDS/camel IgG ratio below 1000. However, in the presence of higher concentrations of SDS (2.5–10.0 mM), amyloid fibril formation was not observed. Furthermore, at the higher concentrations, the $\beta$-sheet structure of camel IgG was transformed into a $\alpha$-helical structure. The amyloid fibril formation was not observed in the presence of SDS at pH 7.4. Additionally, the role of salts and sugars was evaluated in the SDS-induced aggregation process. Interestingly, in the presence of 0.15 N of NaCl and (NH4)2SO4, SDS promoted camel IgG aggregation up to very high concentrations of SDS (0.2–10.0 mM; SDS/camel IgG ratio, 95–4750) and no suppression was observed. Moreover, osmoprotectants (trehalose and sucrose) were ineffective, neither promoting nor inhibiting the SDS-induced aggregation process. However, at pH 3.5, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonds were the major contributing factors in SDS-induced fibrillation. However, no aggregation was observed at pH 7.4 due to electrostatic repulsion between SDS and camel IgG because both of these molecules have overall similar charges.},

To verify the optical properties of the generated beams, Stokes polarimetry is developed to measure the states of polarization (SOP) over the transverse plane, while a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor is used to measure the OAM charge of beams. It is shown that both the simulated and the experimental results are in good qualitative agreement. In addition, polarization patterns and OAM charges of generated beams can be controlled independently using the proposed method.},

abstract = {The etiology of schizophrenia remains unknown. However, using molecular biological techniques, some candidate genes have been identified that might be associated with the disease. One of these candidate genes, disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), was found in a large Scottish family with multiple mental illnesses. The function of DISC1 is considered to be associated with axon elongation and neuron migration in the central nervous system, but the functional consequences of defects in this gene have not been fully clarified in brain neuronal systems. Dysfunction of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neuronal system is also considered to contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Thus, to clarify the neuropathological changes associated with DISC1 dysfunction, we investigated the number and distribution of GABAergic neurons in the prefrontal cortex of DISC1 knockout mice. We immunohistochemically quantified the laminar density of GABAergic neurons using anti-parvalbumin and anti-calbindin D28k antibodies (markers of GABAergic neuronal subpopulations). We found that the densities of both parvalbumin- and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons in the anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal, and orbitofrontal cortices were markedly lower in DISC1 knockout mice than in wild-type mice. In addition, reductions in cell density were observed in layers II and III and the deep layers of the cortex. This reduction in GABAergic neuronal density was not associated with alterations in neuronal size. These findings suggest that disrupted GABAergic neuronal network formation due to a DISC1 deficit might be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {The identification of toxic A$\beta$ species and/or the process of their formation is crucial for understanding the mechanism(s) of A$\beta$ neurotoxicity in Alzheimer disease and also for the development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. To elucidate the structural basis of A$\beta$ toxicity, we developed different procedures to isolate A$\beta$ species of defined size and morphology distribution, and we investigated their toxicity in different cell lines and primary neurons. We observed that crude A$\beta$42 preparations, containing a monomeric and heterogeneous mixture of A$\beta$42 oligomers, were more toxic than purified monomeric, protofibrillar fractions, or fibrils. The toxicity of protofibrils was directly linked to their interactions with monomeric A$\beta$42 and strongly dependent on their ability to convert into amyloid fibrils. Subfractionation of protofibrils diminished their fibrillization and toxicity, whereas reintroduction of monomeric A$\beta$42 into purified protofibril fractions restored amyloid formation and enhanced their toxicity. Selective removal of monomeric A$\beta$42 from these preparations, using insulin-degrading enzyme, reversed the toxicity of A$\beta$42 protofibrils. Together, our findings demonstrate that A$\beta$42 toxicity is not linked to specific prefibrillar aggregate(s) but rather to the ability of these species to grow and undergo fibril formation, which depends on the presence of monomeric A$\beta$42. These findings contribute significantly to the understanding of amyloid formation and toxicity in Alzheimer disease, provide novel insight into mechanisms of A$\beta$ protofibril toxicity, and important implications for designing anti-amyloid therapies. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Transcellular propagation of protein aggregates, or proteopathic seeds, may drive the progression of neurodegenerative diseases in a prion-like manner. In tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, this model predicts that tau seeds propagate pathology through the brain via cell-cell transfer in neural networks. The critical role of tau seeding activity is untested, however. It is unknown whether seeding anticipates and correlates with subsequent development of pathology as predicted for a causal agent. One major limitation has been the lack of a robust assay to measure proteopathic seeding activity in biological specimens. We engineered an ultrasensitive, specific, and facile FRET-based flow cytometry biosensor assay based on expression of tau or synuclein fusions to CFP and YFP, and confirmed its sensitivity and specificity to tau (∼300 fM) and synuclein (∼300 pM) fibrils. This assay readily discriminates Alzheimer's disease vs. Huntington's disease and aged control brains. We then carried out a detailed time-course study in P301S tauopathy mice, comparing seeding activity versus histological markers of tau pathology, including MC1, AT8, PG5, and Thioflavin S. We detected robust seeding activity at 1.5 mo, {\textgreater}1 mo before the earliest histopathological stain. Proteopathic tau seeding is thus an early and robust marker of tauopathy, suggesting a proximal role for tau seeds in neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Proteinaceous deposits of $\alpha$-synuclein amyloid fibrils are a hallmark of human disorders including Parkinson's disease. The onset of this disease is also associated with five familial mutations of the gene encoding the protein. However, the mechanistic link between single point mutations and the kinetics of aggregation, biophysical properties of the resulting amyloid fibrils, and an increased risk of disease is still elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the disease-associated mutations of $\alpha$-synuclein generate different amyloid fibril polymorphs compared to the wild type protein. Remarkably, the $\alpha$-synuclein variants forming amyloid fibrils of a comparable structure, morphology, and heterogeneity show similar microscopic steps defining the aggregation kinetics. These results demonstrate that a single point mutation can significantly alter the distribution of fibrillar polymorphs in $\alpha$-synuclein, suggesting that differences in the clinical phenotypes of familial Parkinson's disease could be associated with differences in the mechanism of formation and the structural characteristics of the aggregates.},

Using complementary microscopic techniques, we here show evidence of such self-organization of the actin cortex in living HeLa cells. During cell adhesion, an active multistage process naturally leads to pattern transitions from actin vortices over stars into asters. This process is primarily driven by Arp2/3 complex nucleation, but not by myosin motors, which is in contrast to what has been theoretically predicted and observed in vitro. Concomitant measurements of mechanics and plasma membrane fluidity demonstrate that changes in actin patterning alter membrane architecture but occur functionally independent of macroscopic cortex elasticity. Consequently, tuning the activity of the Arp2/3 complex to alter filament assembly may thus be a mechanism allowing cells to adjust their membrane architecture without affecting their macroscopic mechanical properties.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are highly polymorphic structures formed by many different proteins. They provide biological function but also abnormally accumulate in numerous human diseases. The physicochemical principles of amyloid polymorphism are not understood due to lack of structural insights at the single-fibril level. To identify and classify different fibril polymorphs and to quantify the level of heterogeneity is essential to decipher the precise links between amyloid structures and their functional and disease associated properties such as toxicity, strains, propagation and spreading. Employing gentle, force-distance curve-based AFM, we produce detailed images, from which the 3D reconstruction of individual filaments in heterogeneous amyloid samples is achieved. Distinctive fibril polymorphs are then classified by hierarchical clustering, and sample heterogeneity is objectively quantified. These data demonstrate the polymorphic nature of fibril populations, provide important information regarding the energy landscape of amyloid self-assembly, and offer quantitative insights into the structural basis of polymorphism in amyloid populations.},

Surface-sensitive techniques amenable to high pressure environments (e.g. PM-IRAS) have sparked a renewed interest in this reaction under realistic pressures. Here, we review recent work in our laboratory examining CO oxidation kinetics on Pt-group single crystals using PM-IRAS, XPS, and mass spectrometry from low (10-8-10-3 Torr) to high (1-102 Torr) pressures. These studies have shown that at both low and high pressures (a) Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics adequately describe CO oxidation kinetics on Pt-group metals (Pt, Pd, Rh) (i.e. there is no pressure gap) and (b) the most active surface is one with minimal CO coverage. Additionally, recent investigations of high pressure CO oxidation kinetics on SiO2 film supported Rh particles prepared in situ are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Overexpression is a notorious concern in conventional and especially in super-resolution fluorescence light microscopy studies because it may cause numerous artifacts including ectopic sub-cellular localizations, erroneous formation of protein complexes, and others. Nonetheless, current live cell super-resolution microscopy studies generally rely on the overexpression of a host protein fused to a fluorescent protein. Here, we establish CRISPR/Cas9-mediated generation of heterozygous and homozygous human knockin cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged proteins from their respective native genomic loci at close to endogenous levels. We tagged three different proteins, exhibiting various localizations and expression levels, with the reversibly switchable fluorescent protein rsEGFP2. We demonstrate the benefit of endogenous expression levels compared to overexpression and show that typical overexpression-induced artefacts were avoided in genome-edited cells. Fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis revealed a narrow distribution of fusion protein expression levels in genome-edited cells, compared to a pronounced variability in transiently transfected cells. Using low light intensity RESOLFT (reversible saturable optical fluorescence transitions) nanoscopy we show sub-diffraction resolution imaging of living human knockin cells. Our strategy to generate human cell lines expressing fluorescent fusion proteins at endogenous levels for RESOLFT nanoscopy can be extended to other fluorescent tags and super-resolution approaches.},

abstract = {Homologous recombination (HR) is required for accurate chromosome segregation during the first meiotic division and constitutes a key repair and tolerance pathway for complex DNA damage, including DNA double-strand breaks, interstrand crosslinks, and DNA gaps. In addition, recombination and replication are inextricably linked, as recombination recovers stalled and broken replication forks, enabling the evolution of larger genomes/replicons. Defects in recombination lead to genomic instability and elevated cancer predisposition, demonstrating a clear cellular need for recombination. However, recombination can also lead to genome rearrangements. Unrestrained recombination causes undesired endpoints (translocation, deletion, inversion) and the accumulation of toxic recombination intermediates. Evidently, HR must be carefully regulated to match specific cellular needs. Here, we review the factors and mechanistic stages of recombination that are subject to regulation and suggest that recombination achieves flexibility and robustness by proceeding through metastable, reversible intermediates.},

The tail fibers of normal phage retract in the absence of a required adsorption cofactor, at low pH, at low ionic strength, at low temperature, and at high concentrations of polyethylene glycol. The tail fibers of mutant whiskerless (wac) phage still retract under the first two conditions, but not the last three. Antibodies to whiskers neutralize T4, probably by fixing tail fibers in the retracted configuration. Phage with retracted tail fibers adsorb poorly to host bacterial cells, and their adsorption rate increases as the fibers become extended. These results suggest that one function of the whiskers is to retract the tail fibers and thereby prevent adsorption to host cells under certain conditions that might be unfavorable for production of phage progeny following infection.},

abstract = {It has been suggested for several years that reactions between ligands and cell surface receptors can be speeded up by nonspecific adsorption of the ligand to the cell surface followed by two-dimensional surface diffusion to the receptor, a mechanism referred to as "reduction-of-dimensionality" (RD) rate enhancement. Most of the theoretical treatments of this and related problems have assumed that the receptor is an irreversibly absorbing perfect sink. Such receptors induce a depletion zone of ligand probability density around themselves. The reaction rate in this case (called "diffusion-limited") is limited only by the time required for ligands to diffuse through this depletion zone. In some cases, however, the receptor may be far from "perfect" such that a collision with a ligand only rarely leads to binding. Receptors then do not create significant local depletion zones of ligand probability density, and the reaction rate becomes strongly affected by the (small) probability of reaction success per diffusive encounter (the "reaction-limited" case). This article presents a simple theory of RD rate enhancement for reaction-limited receptors that are either reversible or irreversible binders. In contrast to the diffusion-limited theories, the reaction-limited theory presented here: (a) differs quantitatively from diffusion-limited models; (b) is simple and algebraic in closed form; (c) exhibits significant rate enhancement in some realistic cases; (d) depends strongly on the actual Brownian rather than pure diffusive nature of the ligand's motion; (e) depends (for irreversibly binding receptors only) on the kinetic rates (not just equilibria) of reversible adsorption to nontarget regions, in contrast to some previous approximate theories of reduction of dimensionality; and (f) is applicable to actual ligand/receptor systems with binding success probabilities at the opposite extreme from the perfect sink/diffusion-limited models.},

abstract = {Statistical fluctuations limit the precision with which a microorganism can, in a given time T, determine the concentration of a chemoattractant in the surrounding medium. The best a cell can do is to monitor continually the state of occupation of receptors distributed over its surface. For nearly optimum performance only a small fraction of the surface need be specifically adsorbing. The probability that a molecule that has collided with the cell will find a receptor is Ns/(Ns + pi a), if N receptors, each with a binding site of radius s, are evenly distributed over a cell of radius a. There is ample room for many indenpendent systems of specific receptors. The adsorption rate for molecules of moderate size cannot be significantly enhanced by motion of the cell or by stirring of the medium by the cell. The least fractional error attainable in the determination of a concentration c is approximately (TcaD) - 1/2, where D is diffusion constant of the attractant. The number of specific receptors needed to attain such precision is about a/s. Data on bacteriophage absorption, bacterial chemotaxis, and chemotaxis in a cellular slime mold are evaluated. The chemotactic sensitivity of Escherichia coli approaches that of the cell of optimum design. {\textcopyright} 1977, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.},

However, these processes result in a wide range of cross-$\beta$ packing and filament arrangements, including diverse assemblies formed from identical monomeric precursors with the same amino acid sequences. Here, we review current structural and mechanistic understanding of amyloid self-assembly, and discuss how mesoscopic, i.e. micrometre to nanometre, organisation of amyloid give rise to suprastructural features that may be the key link between the polymorphic amyloid structures and the biological response they elicit. A greater understanding of the mechanisms governing suprastructure formation will guide future strategies to combat amyloid associated disorders and to use and control the amyloid quaternary structure in synthetic biology and materials applications.},

abstract = {We describe a full structural model for amyloid fibrils formed by the 40-residue $\beta$-amyloid peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease (A$\beta$1-40), based on numerous constraints from solid state NMR and electron microscopy. This model applies specifically to fibrils with a periodically twisted morphology, with twist period equal to 120 ± 20 nm (defined as the distance between apparent minima in fibril width in negatively stained transmission electron microscope images). The structure has threefold symmetry about the fibril growth axis, implied by mass-per-length data and the observation of a single set of 13C NMR signals. Comparison with a previously reported model for A$\beta$1-40 fibrils with a qualitatively different, striated ribbon morphology reveals the molecular basis for polymorphism. At the molecular level, the 2 A$\beta$1-40 fibril morphologies differ in overall symmetry (twofold vs. threefold), the conformation of non-$\beta$-strand segments, and certain quaternary contacts. Both morphologies contain in-register parallel $\beta$-sheets, constructed from nearly the same $\beta$-strand segments. Because twisted and striated ribbon morphologies are also observed for amyloid fibrils formed by other polypeptides, such as the amylin peptide associated with type 2 diabetes, these structural variations may have general implications.},

abstract = {RESOLFT fluorescence nanoscopy can nowadays image details far beyond the diffraction limit. However, signal to noise ratio (SNR) and temporal resolution are still a concern, especially deep inside living cells and organisms. In this work, we developed a non-deterministic scanning approach based on a real-time feedback system which speeds up the acquisition up to 6-fold and decreases the light dose by 70–90{\%} for in vivo imaging. Also, we extended the information content of the images by acquiring the complete temporal evolution of the fluorescence generated by reversible switchable fluorescent proteins. This generates a series of images with different spatial resolution and SNR, from conventional to RESOLFT images, which combined through a multi-image deconvolution algorithm further enhances the effective resolution. We reported nanoscale imaging of organelles up to 35 Hz and actin dynamics during an invasion process at a depth of 20–30 µm inside a living Caenorhabditis elegans worm.},

abstract = {Background Plasma amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptide levels have been examined as a low-cost accessible marker for risk of incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia, but results have varied between studies. We reassessed these associations in one of the largest, prospective, community-based studies to date. Methods A total of 2189 dementia-free, Framingham Study participants aged {\textgreater}60 years (mean age, 72 ± 8 years; 56{\%} women) had plasma A$\beta$1-42 and A$\beta$1-40 measured and were followed prospectively (mean, 7.6 ± 3.0 years) for dementia/AD. Results Increased plasma A$\beta$1-42 levels were associated with lower risk of dementia (A$\beta$1-42: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.80 [0.71{\^{a}}€ 0.90], P {\textless}.001; A$\beta$1-42-to-A$\beta$1-40 ratio: HR = 0.86 [0.76{\^{a}}€ 0.98], P =.027) and AD (A$\beta$1-42: HR = 0.79 [0.69{\^{a}}€ 0.90], P {\textless}.001; A$\beta$1-42-to-A$\beta$1-40 ratio: HR = 0.83 [0.72{\^{a}}€ 0.96], P =.012). Conclusion Our results suggest that lower plasma A$\beta$ levels are associated with risk of incident AD and dementia. They encourage further evaluation of plasma A$\beta$ levels as a biomarker for risk of developing clinical AD and dementia.},

abstract = {Polyphosphate (polyP), which is found in various microorganisms and human cells, is an anionic biopolymer consisting of inorganic phosphates linked by high-energy phosphate bonds. Previous studies revealed that polyPs strongly promoted the amyloid formation of several amyloidogenic proteins; however, the mechanism of polyP-induced amyloid formation remains unclear. In the present study using $\beta$2-microglobulin ($\beta$2m), a protein responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis, we investigated amyloid formation in the presence of various chain lengths of polyPs at different concentrations under both acidic (pH 2.0 to 2.5) and neutral pH (pH 7.0 to 7.5) conditions. We found that the amyloid formation of $\beta$2m at acidic pH was significantly accelerated by the addition of polyPs at an optimal polyP concentration, which decreased with an increase in chain length. The results obtained indicated that electrostatic interactions between positively charged $\beta$2m and negatively charged polyPs play a major role in amyloid formation. Under neutral pH conditions, long polyP with 60 to 70 phosphates induced the amyloid formation of $\beta$2m at several micromoles per liter, a similar concentration range to that in vivo. Since $\beta$2m with an isoelectric point of 6.4 has a slightly negative net charge at pH 7, polyPs were unlikely to interact with $\beta$2m electrostatically. PolyPs appear to dehydrate water molecules around $\beta$2m under the unfolded conformation, leading to the preferential stabilization of less water-exposed amyloid fibrils. These results not only revealed the pH-dependent mechanism of the amyloid formation of $\beta$2m but also suggested that polyPs play an important role in the development of dialysis-related amyloidosis.},

abstract = {Thioflavin T is a benzothiazole dye that exhibits enhanced fluorescence upon binding to amyloid fibrils and is commonly used to diagnose amyloid fibrils, both ex vivo and in vitro. In aqueous solutions, thioflavin T was found to exist as micelles at concentrations commonly used to monitor fibrils by fluorescence assay (∼10-20 $\mu$M). Specific conductivity changes were measured at varying concentration of thioflavin T and the critical micellar concentration was calculated to be 4.0 ± 0.5 $\mu$M. Interestingly, changes in the fluorescence excitation and emission of thioflavin T were also dependent on the micelle formation. The thioflavin T micelles of 3 nm diameter were directly visualized using atomic force microscopy, and bound thioflavin T micelles were observed along the fibril length for representative fibrils. Increasing concentration of thioflavin T above the critical micellar concentration shows increased numbers of micelles bound along the length of the amyloid fibrils. Thioflavin T micelles were disrupted at low pH as observed by atomic force microscopy and fluorescence enhancement upon binding of thioflavin T to amyloid fibrils also reduced by several-fold upon decreasing the pH to below 3. This suggests that positive charge on the thioflavin T molecule has a role in its micelle formation that then bind the amyloid fibrils. Our data suggests that the micelles of thioflavin T bind amyloid fibrils leading to enhancement of fluorescence emission. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of protein misfolding and aggregation results in the formation of highly heterogeneous protein aggregates, which are associated with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In particular low molecular weight aggregates, amyloid oligomers, have been shown to possess generic cytotoxic properties and are implicated as neurotoxins in many forms of dementia. We illustrate the use of methods based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) to address the challenging task of characterizing the morphological, structural and chemical properties of these aggregates, which are difficult to study using conventional structural methods or bulk biophysical methods because of their heterogeneity and transient nature. Scanning probe microscopy approaches are now capable of investigating the morphology of amyloid aggregates with sub-nanometer resolution. We show here that infrared (IR) nanospectroscopy (AFM-IR), which simultaneously exploits the high resolution of AFM and the chemical recognition power of IR spectroscopy, can go further and enable the characterization of the structural properties of individual protein aggregates, and thus offer insights into the aggregation mechanisms. Since the approach that we describe can be applied also to the investigations of the interactions of protein assemblies with small molecules and antibodies, it can deliver fundamental information to develop new therapeutic compounds to diagnose or treat neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {Both oxidative stress and aggregation of the protein $\alpha$-synuclein (aS) have been implicated as key factors in the etiology of Parkinson's disease. Specifically, oxidative modifications to aS disrupt its binding to lipid membranes, an interaction considered critical to its native function. Here we seek to provide a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon by investigating the effects of oxidative nitration of tyrosine residues on the structure of aS and its interaction with lipid membranes. Membrane binding is mediated by the first ∼95 residues of aS. We find that nitration of the single tyrosine (Y39) in this domain disrupts binding due to electrostatic repulsion. Moreover, we observe that nitration of the three tyrosines (Y125/133/136) in the C-terminal domain is equally effective in perturbing binding, an intriguing result given that the C-terminus is not thought to interact directly with the lipid bilayer. Our investigations show that tyrosine nitration results in a change of the conformational states populated by aS in solution, with the most prominent changes occurring in the C-terminal region. These results lead us to suggest that nitration of Y125/133/136 reduces the membrane-binding affinity of aS through allosteric coupling by altering the ensemble of conformational states and depopulating those capable of membrane binding. While allostery is a well-established concept for structured proteins, it has only recently been discussed in the context of disordered proteins. We propose that allosteric regulation through modification of specific residues in, or ligand binding to, the C-terminus may even be a general mechanism for modulating aS function. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Here, we show that the actin-binding domains of accessory proteins can be sensitive to filament conformational changes induced by perturbations that include other binding proteins, stabilizing drugs, and physical constraints on the filament. Using a combination of live cell imaging and in vitro single molecule binding measurements, we demonstrate that the affinity of tandem calponin homology domain (CH1-CH2) mutants varies as actin filament twist is altered, and we show differential localization of native and mutant CH1-CH2 domains to actin networks at the front and rear of motile cells. These findings suggest that conformational heterogeneity of actin filaments in cells could influence the biochemical composition of cytoskeletal structures through a biophysical feedback loop.},

Of the disease associated amyloid assemblies, a diverse array of species, ranging from small oligomeric assembly intermediates to fibrillar structures, have been shown to have toxic potential. Equally, a range of species formed by the same disease associated amyloid sequences have been found to be relatively benign under comparable monomer equivalent concentrations and conditions. In recent years, an increasing number of functional amyloid systems have also been found. These developments show that not all amyloid structures are generically toxic to cells. Given these observations, it is important to understand why amyloid structures may encode such varied toxic potential despite sharing a common core molecular architecture. Here, we discuss possible links between different aspects of amyloidogenic structures and assembly mechanisms with their varied functional effects. We propose testable hypotheses for the relationship between amyloid structure and its toxic potential in the context of recent reports on amyloid sequence, structure, and toxicity relationships.},

Specifically, the enzymes pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase have been directed to the filaments, leading to enhanced ethanol production in these engineered bacterial cells compared to those that do not produce the scaffold. This is consistent with improved metabolic efficiency through enzyme colocation. Finally, the shell-protein scaffold can be directed to the inner membrane of the cell, demonstrating how synthetic cellular organization can be coupled with spatial optimization through in-cell protein design.

abstract = {(Figure Presented) Amyloid peptides are the main component of one of the characteristic pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD): senile plaques. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, amyloid peptides may play a central role in the sequence of events that leads to neurodegeneration. However, there are other factors, such as oxidative stress, that may be crucial for the development of the disease. In the present paper, we show that it is possible, by using Fourier tranform infrared (FTIR) microscopy, to co-localize amyloid deposits and lipid peroxidation in tissue slides from patients affected by Alzheimer' s disease. Plaques and lipids can be analyzed in the same sample, making use of the characteristic infrared bands for peptide aggregation and lipid oxidation. The results show that, in samples from patients diagnosed with AD, the plaques and their immediate surroundings are always characterized by the presence of oxidized lipids. As for samples from non-AD individuals, those without amyloid plaques show a lower level of lipid oxidation than AD individuals. However, it is known that plaques can be detected in the brains of some non-AD individuals. Our results show that, in such cases, the lipid in the plaques and their surroundings display oxidation levels that are similar to those of tissues with no plaques. These results point to lipid oxidation as a possible key factor in the path that goes from showing the typical neurophatological hallmarks to suffering from dementia. In this process, the oxidative power of the amyloid peptide, possibly in the form of nonfibrillar aggregates, could play a central role.},

abstract = {Adsorption of $\lambda$-phage on sensitive bacteria Escherichia coli is a classical problem but not all issues have been resolved. One of the outstanding problems is the rate of adsorption, which in some cases appears to exceed the theoretical limit imposed by the law of random diffusion. We revisit this problem by conducting experiments along with new theoretical analyses. Our measurements show that upon incubating $\lambda$-phage with bacteria Ymel, the population of unbound phage in a salt buffer decreases with time and in general obeys a double-exponential function characterized by a fast ($\tau$1) and a slow ($\tau$2) decay time. We found that both the fast and the slow processes are specific to interactions between l-phage and its receptor LamB. Such specificity motivates a kinetic model that describes the interaction between the phage and the receptor as an on-and-off process followed by an irreversible binding. The latter may be a signature of the initiation of DNA translocation. The kinetic model successfully predicts the double exponential behavior seen in the experiment and allows the corresponding rate constants to be extracted from single measurements. The weak temperature dependence of the reversible and the irreversible binding rate suggests that phage retention by the receptor is entropic in nature and that a molecular key-lock interaction may be an appropriate description of the interaction between the phage tail and the receptor. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a lethal disease characterized by the deposition of the immunoglobulin light chain into amyloid fibrils, resulting in organ dysfunction and failure. Amyloid fibrils have the ability to self-propagate, recruiting soluble protein into the fibril by a nucleation-polymerization mechanism, characteristic of autocatalytic reactions. Experimental data suggest the existence of a critical concentration for initiation of fibril formation. As such, the initial concentration of soluble amyloidogenic protein is expected to have a profound effect on the rate of fibril formation. In this work, we present in vitro evidence that fibril formation rates for AL light chains are affected by the protein concentration in a differential manner. De novo reactions of the proteins with the fastest amyloid kinetics (AL-09, AL-T05, and AL-103) do not present protein concentration dependence. Seeded reactions, however, exhibited weak protein concentration dependence. For AL-12, seeded and protein concentration dependence data suggest a synergistic effect for recruitment and elongation at low protein concentrations, while reactions of $\kappa$I exhibited poor efficiency in nucleating and elongating preformed fibrils. Additionally, co-aggregation and cross seeding of $\kappa$I variable domain (VL) and the $\kappa$I full length (FL) light chain indicate that the presence of the constant domain in $\kappa$I FL modulates fibril formation, facilitating the recruitment of $\kappa$I VL. Together, these results indicate that the dominant process in fibril formation varies among the AL proteins tested with a differential dependence of the protein concentration.},

Previous studies have revealed that Cas12a has unique features distinct from Cas9, but the detailed mechanisms of target searching and DNA cleavage by Cas12a are still unclear. Here, we directly observe this entire process by using single-molecule fluorescence assays to study Cas12a from Acidaminococcus sp. (AsCas12a). We determine that AsCas12a ribonucleopro-teins search for their on-target site by a one-dimensional diffusion along elongated DNA molecules and induce cleavage in the two DNA strands in a well-defined order, beginning with the non-target strand. Furthermore, the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) for AsCas12a makes only a limited contribution of DNA unwinding during R-loop formation and shows a negligible role in the process of DNA cleavage, in contrast to the Cas9 PAM.},

abstract = {Viral infection begins with the binding of a virus to a specific target on the surface of the host cell, followed by viral genome delivery into the host and a continuation of the infection process. Before binding occurs, the virus must first find its receptor by a process whose details are largely unknown. We applied high-resolution fluorescence microscopy and single-particle tracking to elucidate the target-finding process in bacteriophage $\lambda$ as it infects an Escherichia coli cell. By monitoring the motion of individual viruses through the early stages of infection, we identified a unique spatial focusing process that allows a virus to arrive from its initial random landing site to its destination at the cell pole. The search process is governed by the interaction between the virus and the LamB receptors, and by the spatial organization of the receptor network on the cell surface. Our findings allowed us to develop a theoretical model for the target-finding process that reproduces the key features observed in experiment. We discuss the possible implications of our findings for the process of viral receptor-finding in higher systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Essential cellular functions as diverse as genome maintenance and tissue morphogenesis rely on the dynamic organization of filamentous assemblies. For example, the precise structural organization of DNA filaments has profound consequences on all DNA-mediated processes including gene expression, whereas control over the precise spatial arrangement of cytoskeletal protein filaments is key for mechanical force generation driving animal tissue morphogenesis. Polarized fluorescence is currently used to extract structural organization of fluorescently labeled biological filaments by determining the orientation of fluorescent labels, however with a strong drawback: polarized fluorescence imaging is indeed spatially limited by optical diffraction, and is thus unable to discriminate between the intrinsic orientationalmobility of the fluorophore labels and the real structural disorder of the labeled biomolecules. Here, we demonstrate that quantitative single-molecule polarized detection in biological filament assemblies allows not only to correct for the rotational flexibility of the label but also to image orientational order of filaments at the nanoscale using superresolution capabilities. The method is based on polarized direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, using dedicated optical scheme and image analysis to determine both molecular localization and orientation with high precision. We apply this method to double-stranded DNA in vitro and microtubules and actin stress fibers in whole cells.},

abstract = {Fusion of tomographic radionuclide studies with anatomical examinations has become standard practice in positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Nonetheless, fusion of planar scintigraphic images with an anatomical modality remains distinctly uncommon, although methods to do so have appeared sporadically in the literature during the past 2 decades. In this article we review several techniques that have been used to combine planar scintigraphic images with radiographs and visual (photographic) images. Rigid or affine transformations have been performed to co-register the planar images with each other using custom, commercial, or public domain software. Display of the hybrid images has been achieved primarily with nonselective color-fusion methods. Promising efforts are underway to develop a technique of fusing planar lymphoscintigraphic images with CT topograms (scout images) obtained on the SPECT-CT camera in a manner that compensates for position-dependent variation in magnification that affects the CT scout. An advantage of this approach is that both of the component images are acquired on the same gantry, without need for repositioning of the patient. It is instructive to note that techniques of fusing rectilinear scans with radiographic and visual images were first developed more than 50 years ago. The revisiting of these methods after many decades reflects a fundamental need for spatial orientation in nuclear medicine that fusion imaging can also bring to planar scintigraphic studies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Many chemical and biological systems exhibit intermittent search phenomena when participating particles alternate between dynamic regimes with different dimensionalities. Here we investigate theoretically a dynamic search process of finding a small target on a two-dimensional surface starting from a bulk solution, which is an example of such an intermittent search process. Both continuum and discrete-state stochastic descriptions are developed. It is found that depending on the scanning length $\lambda$, which describes the area visited by the reacting molecule during one search cycle, the system can exhibit three different search regimes: (i) For small $\lambda$ values, the reactant finds the target mostly via three-dimensional bulk diffusion; (ii) for large $\lambda$ values, the reactant molecule associates to the target mostly via surface diffusion; and (iii) for intermediate $\lambda$ values, the reactant reaches the target via a combination of three-dimensional and two-dimensional search cycles. Our analysis also shows that the mean search times have different scalings as a function of the size of the surface segment depending on the nature of the dynamic search regime. Search dynamics are also sensitive to the position of the target for large scanning lengths. In addition, it is argued that the continuum description underestimates mean search times and does not always correctly describe the most optimal conditions for the surface-assisted dynamic processes. The importance of our findings for real natural systems is discussed.},

abstract = {Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) most commonly known as prion diseases are invariably fatal neurological disorders that affect humans and animals. These disorders differ from other neurodegenerative conformational diseases caused by the accumulation in the brain of misfolded proteins, sometimes with amyloid properties, in their ability to infect susceptible species by various routes. While the infectious properties of amyloidogenic proteins, other than misfolded prion protein (PrPTSE), are currently under scrutiny, their potential to transmit from cell to cell, one of the intrinsic properties of the prion, has been recently shown in vitro and in vivo. Over the decades, various cell culture and laboratory animal models have been developed to study TSEs. These assays have been widely used in a variety of applications but showed to be time consuming and entailed elevated costs. Novel economic and fast alternatives became available with the development of in vitro assays that are based on the property of conformationally abnormal PrPTSE to recruit normal cellular PrPC to misfold. These include the cell-free conversion assay, protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) and quaking induced conversion assay (QuIC), of which the PMCA has been the only technology shown to generate infectious prions. Moreover, it allows indefinite amplification of PrPTSE with strain-specific biochemical and biological properties of the original molecules and under certain conditions may give rise to new spontaneously generated prions. The method also allows addressing the species barrier phenomena and assessing possible risks of animal-to-animal and animal-to-human transmission. Additionally, its unprecedented sensitivity has made possible the detection of as little as one infectious dose of PrPTSE and the biochemical identification of this protein in different tissues and biological fluids, including blood, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), semen, milk, urine and saliva during the pre-clinical and clinical phases of the disease. The mechanistic similarities between TSEs and other conformational disorders have resulted in the adaptation of the PMCA to the amplification and detection of various amyloidogenic proteins. Here we provide a compelling discussion of the different applications of this technology to the study of TSEs and other neurodegenerative diseases.},

The increased energy of the proton beams and the higher luminosity required a redesign of LUCID to cope with the more demanding conditions. The novelty of the LUCID-2 detector is that it uses the thin quartz windows of photomultipliers as Cherenkov medium and a small amounts of radioactive 207Bi sources deposited on to these windows to monitor the gain stability of the photomultipliers. The result is a fast and accurate luminosity determination that can be kept stable during many months of data taking. LUCID-2 can also measure the luminosity accurately online for each of the up to 2808 colliding bunch pairs in the LHC .

abstract = {Pathogenic Yersinia bacteria cause a range of human diseases. To modulate and evade host immune systems, these yersiniae inject effector proteins into host macrophages. One such protein, the serine/threonine kinase YopO (YpkA in Yersinia pestis), uses monomeric actin as bait to recruit and phosphorylate host actin polymerization-regulating proteins, including the actin-severing protein gelsolin, to disrupt actin filaments and thus impair phagocytosis. However, the YopO phosphorylation sites on gelsolin and the consequences of YopO-mediated phosphorylation on actin remodeling have yet to be established. Here we determined the effects of YopO-mediated phosphorylation on gelsolin and identified its phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry. YopO phosphorylated gelsolin in the linker region between gelsolin homology domains G3 and G4, which, in the absence of calcium, are compacted but adopt an open conformation in the presence of calcium, enabling actin binding and severing. Using phosphomimetic and phosphodeletion gelsolin mutants, we found that YopO-mediated phosphorylation partially mimics calcium-dependent activation of gelsolin, potentially contributing to a reduction in filamentous actin and altered actin dynamics in phagocytic cells. In summary, this work represents the first report of the functional outcome of serine/threonine phosphorylation in gelsolin regulation and provides critical insight into how YopO disrupts normal gelsolin function to alter host actin dynamics and thus cripple phagocytosis.},

These amyloid fibrils were long suspected to be the disease agents, but evidence suggests that smaller, often transient and polymorphic oligomers are the toxic entities. Here, we identify a segment of the amyloid-forming protein $\alpha$B crystallin, which forms an oligomeric complex exhibiting properties of other amyloid oligomers: $\beta$-sheet-rich structure, cytotoxicity, and recognition by an oligomer-specific antibody. The x-ray-derived atomic structure of the oligomer reveals a cylindrical barrel, formed from six antiparallel protein strands, that we term a cylindrin. The cylindrin structure is compatible with a sequence segment from the $\beta$-amyloid protein of Alzheimer's disease. Cylindrins offer models for the hitherto elusive structures of amyloid oligomers.},

However, no disease-modifying drug has become available for clinical use to date for these conditions. One of the main reasons for this failure is the incomplete knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the process by which small molecules interact with protein aggregates and interfere with their aggregation pathways. Here, we leverage the single molecule morphological and chemical sensitivity of infrared nanospectroscopy to provide the first direct measurement of the structure and interaction between single A$\beta$42 oligomeric and fibrillar species and an aggregation inhibitor, bexarotene, which is able to prevent A$\beta$42 aggregation in vitro and reverses its neurotoxicity in cell and animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that the carboxyl group of this compound interacts with A$\beta$42 aggregates through a single hydrogen bond. These results establish infrared nanospectroscopy as a powerful tool in structure-based drug discovery for protein misfolding diseases.},

abstract = {This article reviews recent progress on hybrid perovskites including crystal/thin-film synthesis, structural/chemical/electro-optical properties, (opto)electronic applications, and research issues/challenges. Organic and inorganic hybrid perovskites ( e.g. , CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ), with advantages of facile processing, tunable bandgaps, and superior charge-transfer properties, have emerged as a new class of revolutionary optoelectronic semiconductors promising for various applications. Perovskite solar cells constructed with a variety of configurations have demonstrated unprecedented progress in efficiency, reaching about 20{\%} from multiple groups after only several years of active research. A key to this success is the development of various solution-synthesis and film-deposition techniques for controlling the morphology and composition of hybrid perovskites. The rapid progress in material synthesis and device fabrication has also promoted the development of other optoelectronic applications including light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and transistors. Both experimental and theoretical investigations on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have enabled some critical fundamental understandings of this material system. Recent studies have also demonstrated progress in addressing the potential stability issue, which has been identified as a main challenge for future research on halide perovskites. Here, we review recent progress on hybrid perovskites including basic chemical and crystal structures, chemical synthesis of bulk/nanocrystals and thin films with their chemical and physical properties, device configurations, operation principles for various optoelectronic applications (with a focus on solar cells), and photophysics of charge-carrier dynamics. We also discuss the importance of further understanding of the fundamental properties of hybrid perovskites, especially those related to chemical and structural stabilities. },

abstract = {Individuals carrying BRCA2 mutations are predisposed to breast and ovarian cancers. Here, we show that BRCA2 plays a dual role in regulating the actions of RAD51, a protein essential for homologous recombination and DNA repair. First, interactions between RAD51 and the BRC3 or BRC4 regions of BRCA2 block nucleoprotein filament formation by RAD51. Alterations to the BRC3 region that mimic cancer-associated BRCA2 mutations fail to exhibit this effect. Second, transport of RAD51 to the nucleus is defective in cells carrying a cancer-associated BRCA2 truncation. Thus, BRCA2 regulates both the intracellular localization and DNA binding ability of RAD51. Loss of these controls following BRCA2 inactivation may be a key event leading to genomic instability and tumorigenesis.},

We successfully detect random coil to cross $\beta$-sheet conformational changes associated with $\alpha$-synuclein protein aggregation, a detrimental process in many neurodegenerative disorders. Notably, our experimental results demonstrate high conformational sensitivity by differentiating subtle secondary-structural variations in a native $\beta$-sheet protein monolayer from those of cross $\beta$-sheets, which are characteristic of pathological aggregates.

By harnessing live-cell stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy and the fluorescent probe SiR-Actin, we show that the periodic subcortical actin structure is in fact present in both axons and dendrites. The periodic cytoskeleton organization is also found in the peripheral nervous system, specifically at the nodes of Ranvier. The actin patches in the AIS co-localize with pre-synaptic markers. Cytosolic actin organization strongly depends on the developmental stage and subcellular localization. Altogether, the results of this study reveal unique neuronal cytoskeletal features.},

abstract = {Advances in SPECT and PET imaging hardware, software, and radiotracers are vastly improving the non-invasive evaluation of myocardial perfusion and function. In contrast to traditional dual-headed, sodium iodide crystal and photomultiplier cameras with mechanical collimators, new SPECT camera designs utilize novel, collimators, and solid-state detectors that convert photons directly to electrical signals. These cameras simultaneously collect data from as many as 76 small detectors narrowly focused on the heart. New noise regularization and resolution recovery/noise reduction reconstruction software interprets emitted counts more efficiently and thus more effectively discriminates between useful signals and noise. As a result, shorter acquisition times and/or lower tracer doses produce higher quality SPECT images than were possible before. PET perfusion imaging has benefitted from the introduction of novel detectors that now allow true 3D imaging, new radiopharmaceuticals, and precise attenuation correction (AC). These developments have resulted in perfusion images with higher spatial and contrast resolution that may be acquired in shorter protocols and/or with less patient radiation exposure than traditional SPECT. Hybrid SPECT/CT and PET/CT cameras utilize transmission computed tomographic (CT) scans for AC, and offer the additional clinical advantages of evaluating coronary calcium, myocardial anatomy (including non-invasive CT angiography), myocardial function, and myocardial perfusion in a single imaging procedure.},

abstract = {Very high resolution X-ray imaging has been the subject of considerable research over the past few decades. However, the spatial resolution of these methods is limited by the manufacturing quality of the X-ray optics. More recently, lensless X-ray imaging has emerged as a powerful approach that is able to circumvent this limitation. A number of classes of lensless X-ray imaging have been developed so far, with many based on other forms of optics. Here we report the key progress in this area, describe the potential applications for biology and materials science, and discuss the prospect for imaging single molecules using X-ray free-electron lasers. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Cell invasion through extracellular matrix (ECM) has pivotal roles in cell dispersal during development, immune cell trafficking, and cancer metastasis. Many elegant studies have revealed the specialized cellular protrusions, proteases, and distinct modes of migration invasive cells use to overcome ECM barriers. Less clear, however, is how invasive cells provide energy, specifically ATP, to power the energetically demanding membrane trafficking, F-actin polymerization, and acto-myosin machinery that mediate break down, remodeling, and movement through ECMs. Here, we provide an overview of the challenges of examining ATP generation and delivery within invading cells and how recent studies using diverse invasion models, experimental approaches, and energy biosensors are revealing that energy metabolism is an integral component of cell invasive behavior that is dynamically tuned to overcome the ECM environment. Invasion through ECM Requires Energy Intensive Cellular Machinery Animals are made of tissues comprising cells that are scaffolded, shaped, and confined by macromolecular assemblies of extracellular matrix (ECM, see Glossary). Several cell types acquire the specialized ability to invade through ECM. For example, vertebrate neural crest cells invade through ECM to disperse and form skeletal structures, nerves, and pigment cells [1], and leukocytes traverse ECM to reach sites of infection and injury [2]. Dysregulation of invasion occurs in human pathologies, such as rheumatoid arthritis [3], multiple sclerosis [4], and cancer [5]. Given its importance to human health, particularly in driving metastatic cancer, there has been significant interest in understanding how cells invade. ECMs take several major forms, such as thin, dense, planar basement membrane matrices that surround tissues; 3D, fibrillar, type I collagen-rich interstitial matrices that sit between tissues; and rigid, dense, mineralized bone [6]. Each ECM offers unique obstacles for invading cells. Examining how invasive cells dynamically interact with, and overcome, ECM barriers has been a primary focus in the field and we know a great deal about the regulation and function of specialized F-actin-rich invasive protrusions, termed invadopodia and podosomes [7-9], and the dynamic trafficking of ECM-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [10-12]. Many studies have also elucidated the rapid and flexible conversion between migration modes (mesenchymal, amoeboid, lobopodial, and collective) that invasive cells undergo [13-15]. Although these aspects of invasion are crucial in breaching ECM, force-producing F-actin polymerization and actomyosin contraction as well as MMP delivery and membrane trafficking are energetically demanding processes [16-20], and less is known about how cells power cell invasion. Investigations of how cells fuel invasion have primarily studied invasive cancer cell lines and the Caenorhabditis elegans anchor cell (AC), which carries out a normal invasion event that shares many features with cancer cells [21-24]. In this review, we outline these studies that inform current knowledge of this key, but understudied, aspect of cell invasion. Oxidative Phosphorylation and Glycolysis Are the Primary Sources of ATP ATP is the main energy currency in cells, and the formation, hydrolysis, or transfer of the high-energy terminal phosphate bond in ATP is the link between energy-producing and energy},

abstract = {We report on the development of an on-chip RPA (recombinase polymerase amplification) with simultaneous multiplex isothermal amplification and detection on a solid surface. The isothermal RPA was applied to amplify specific target sequences from the pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using genomic DNA. Additionally, a positive plasmid control was established as an internal control. The four targets were amplified simultaneously in a quadruplex reaction. The amplicon is labeled during on-chip RPA by reverse oligonucleotide primers coupled to a fluorophore. Both amplification and spatially resolved signal generation take place on immobilized forward primers bount to expoxy-silanized glass surfaces in a pump-driven hybridization chamber. The combination of microarray technology and sensitive isothermal nucleic acid amplification at 38 °C allows for a multiparameter analysis on a rather small area. The on-chip RPA was characterized in terms of reaction time, sensitivity and inhibitory conditions. A successful enzymatic reaction is completed in {\textless}20 min and results in detection limits of 10 colony-forming units for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica and 100 colony-forming units for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The results show this method to be useful with respect to point-of-care testing and to enable simplified and miniaturized nucleic acid-based diagnostics.

The enteric pathogenic Yersinia species Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica and the causative agent of plague, Yersinia pestis, are able to survive in a large variety of environmental reservoirs (e.g., soil, plants, insects) as well as warm-blooded animals (e.g., rodents, pigs, humans) with a particular preference for lymphatic tissues. In order to manage rapidly changing environmental conditions and interbacterial competition, Yersinia senses the nutritional composition during the course of an infection by special molecular devices, integrates this information and adapts its metabolism accordingly. In addition, nutrient availability has an impact on expression of virulence genes in response to C-sources, demonstrating a tight link between the pathogenicity of yersiniae and utilization of nutrients. Recent studies revealed that global regulatory factors such as the cAMP receptor protein (Crp) and the carbon storage regulator (Csr) system are part of a large network of transcriptional and posttranscriptional control strategies adjusting metabolic changes and virulence in response to temperature, ion and nutrient availability. Gained knowledge about the specific metabolic requirements and the correlation between metabolic and virulence gene expression that enable efficient host colonization led to the identification of new potential antimicrobial targets.},

Here, we show that the nanomotion detector can assess the viability of a vast range of biological specimens and that it could be the perfect complement to conventional chemical life-detection assays.

The best studied of these is the prion domain (NM) of Sup35, which forms an amyloid that can adopt several distinct conformations (strains) that produce distinct phenotypes. Using magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we provide a detailed look at the dynamic properties of these forms over a broad range of timescales. We establish that different prion strains have distinct amyloid structures, with many side chains in different chemical environments. Surprisingly, the prion strain with a larger fraction of rigid residues also has a larger fraction of highly mobile residues. Differences in mobility correlate with differences in interaction with the prion-partitioning factor Hsp104 in vivo, perhaps explaining strain-specific differences in inheritance. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Postmortem brain tissue from patients with AD had measurable amounts of pathological A$\beta$ conformers. Individuals over 80 years of age had the lowest amounts of prion-like A$\beta$ and phosphorylated tau. Unexpectedly, the longevity-dependent decrease in self-propagating tau conformers occurred in spite of increasing amounts of total insoluble tau. When corrected for the abundance of insoluble tau, the ability of postmortem AD brain homogenates to induce misfolded tau in the cellular assays showed an exponential decrease with longevity, with a half-life of about one decade over the age range of 37 to 99 years. Thus, our findings demonstrate an inverse correlation between longevity in patients with AD and the abundance of pathological tau conformers.

abstract = {IR spectroscopy is an excellent method for biological analyses. It enables the nonperturbative, label-free extraction of biochemical information and images toward diagnosis and the assessment of cell functionality. Although not strictly microscopy in the conventional sense, it allows the construction of images of tissue or cell architecture by the passing of spectral data through a variety of computational algorithms. Because such images are constructed from fingerprint spectra, the notion is that they can be an objective reflection of the underlying health status of the analyzed sample. One of the major difficulties in the field has been determining a consensus on spectral pre-processing and data analysis. This manuscript brings together as coauthors some of the leaders in this field to allow the standardization of methods and procedures for adapting a multistage approach to a methodology that can be applied to a variety of cell biological questions or used within a clinical setting for disease screening or diagnosis. We describe a protocol for collecting IR spectra and images from biological samples (e.g., fixed cytology and tissue sections, live cells or biofluids) that assesses the instrumental options available, appropriate sample preparation, different sampling modes as well as important advances in spectral data acquisition. After acquisition, data processing consists of a sequence of steps including quality control, spectral pre-processing, feature extraction and classification of the supervised or unsupervised type. A typical experiment can be completed and analyzed within hours. Example results are presented on the use of IR spectra combined with multivariate data processing. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nature America, Inc.},

We discuss the formation mechanisms of such singular beams in few-mode fibers under the vortex basis and show recent advances in generating techniques that are mainly based on long-period fiber gratings, mode-selective couplers, offset-spliced fibers, and tapered fibers. The performances of cylindrical vector beams and vortex beams generated in fibers and fiber lasers are summarized and compared to give a comprehensive understanding of singular beams and to promote their practical applications.},

abstract = {The $\alpha$$\beta$ T-cell coreceptor CD4 enhances immune responses more than 1 million-fold in some assays, and yet the affinity of CD4 for its ligand, peptide-major histocompatibility class II (pMHC II) on antigen-presenting cells, is so weak that it was previously unquantifiable. Here, we report that a soluble form of CD4 failed to bind detectably to pMHC II in surface plasmon resonance-based assays, establishing a new upper limit for the solution affinity at 2.5 mM. However, when presented multivalently on magnetic beads, soluble CD4 bound pMHC II-expressing B cells, confirming that it is active and allowing mapping of the native coreceptor binding site on pMHC II. Whereas binding was undetectable in solution, the affinity of the CD4/pMHC II interaction could be measured in 2D using CD4- and adhesion molecule-functionalized, supported lipid bilayers, yielding a 2D Kd of ∼5,000 molecules/$\mu$m2. This value is two to three orders of magnitude higher than previously measured 2D Kd values for interacting leukocyte surface proteins. Calculations indicated, however, that CD4/pMHC II binding would increase rates of T-cell receptor (TCR) complex phosphorylation by threefold via the recruitment of Lck, with only a small, 2-20{\%} increase in the effective affinity of the TCR for pMHC II. The affinity of CD4/pMHC II therefore seems to be set at a value that increases T-cell sensitivity by enhancing phosphorylation, without compromising ligand discrimination.},

abstract = {Application of surface-science techniques, such as XPS, SXRD, STM, and IR spectroscopy under catalytic reactions conditions yield new structural and chemical information. Recent experiments focusing on CO oxidation over Pt and Pd model catalysts were reviewed. Platinum and palladium are frequently used as catalytic materials, for example for the oxidation of CO. This is one of the most widely studied reactions in the field of surface science. Although seemingly uncomplicated, it remains an active and interesting topic, which is partially explained by the push to conduct experiments on model systems under relevant reaction conditions. Recent developments in the surface-science methodology have allowed obtaining chemical and structural information on the active phase of model catalysts. Tools of the trade include near-ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-pressure scanning tunneling microscopy, high-pressure surface X-ray diffraction, and high-pressure vibrational spectroscopy. Interpretation is often aided by density functional theory in combination with thermodynamic and kinetic modeling. In this review, results for the catalytic oxidation of CO obtained by these techniques are compared. On several of the Pt and Pd surfaces, new structures develop in excess O 2 . For Pt, this requires a much larger excess of O 2 than for Pd. Most of these structures also develop in pure O 2 and are identified as (surface) oxides. A large body of evidence supports the conjecture that these oxides are more reactive than the corresponding O-covered metallic surfaces under similar conditions, although still debated in the literature. An outlook on this developing field, including directions that move away from CO oxidation towards more complex chemistry, concludes this review. },

abstract = {The wac gene product (gpwac) or fibritin of bacteriophage T4 forms the six fibers that radiate from the phage neck. During phage morphogenesis these whiskers bind the long tail fibers (LTFs) and facilitate their attachment to the phage baseplate. After the cell lysis, the gpwac fibers function as part of an environmental sensing device that retains the LTFs in a retracted configuration and thus prevents phage adsorption in unfavorable conditions. A comparative analysis of the sequences of 5 wac gene orthologs from various T4-type phages reveals that the approximately 50-amino-acid N-terminal domain is the only highly conserved segment of the protein. This sequence conservation is probably a direct consequence of the domain's strong and specific interactions with the neck proteins. The sequence of the central fibrous region of gpwac is highly plastic, with only the heptad periodicity of the coiled-coil structure being conserved. In the various gpwac sequences, the small C-terminal domain essential for initiation of the folding of T4 gpwac is replaced by unrelated sequences of unknown origin. When a distant T4-type phage has a novel C-terminal gpwac sequence, the phage's gp36 sequence that is located at the knee joint of the LTF invariably has a novel domain in its C terminus as well. The covariance of these two sequences is compatible with genetic data suggesting that the C termini of gpwac and gp36 engage in a protein-protein interaction that controls phage infectivity. These results add to the limited evidence for domain swapping in the evolution of phage structural proteins.},

abstract = {For about a decade, superresolution fluorescence microscopy has been advancing steadily, maturing from the proof-of-principle stage to routine application. Of the various techniques, STED (stimulated emission depletion) microscopy was the first to break the diffraction barrier. Today, it is a prominent and versatile form of superresolution light microscopy. STED microscopy has shed a sharper light on numerous topics in cell biology, but also in material sciences. Both disciplines extend into the nanometer range, making detailed studies of structural and functional relationships difficult or even impossible to achieve using diffraction-limited microscopy. With recent advancements like spectral multiplexing or live-cell imaging, STED microscopy makes nanoscale materials and components of the cell accessible for fluorescence-based investigations. With multicolor superresolution imaging, even the interactions between biological and engineered nanostructures can be studied in detail. This review gives an introduction into the working principle of STED microscopy, provides a detailed overview of recent advancements and new techniques implemented for use with STED microscopy and shows how these have been applied in the life sciences and nanotechnologies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

abstract = {The formation of amyloid-$\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$) oligomers at the cellular membrane is considered to be a crucial process underlying neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, it is critical to characterize the oligomers that form within a membrane environment. To contribute to this characterization, we have applied strategies widely used to examine the structure of membrane proteins to study the two major A$\beta$ variants, A$\beta$40 and A$\beta$42. Accordingly, various types of detergent micelles were extensively screened to identify one that preserved the properties of A$\beta$ in lipid environments-namely the formation of oligomers that function as pores. Remarkably, under the optimized detergent micelle conditions, A$\beta$40 and A$\beta$42 showed different behavior. A$\beta$40 aggregated into amyloid fibrils, whereas A$\beta$42 assembled into oligomers that inserted into lipid bilayers as well-defined pores and adopted a specific structure with characteristics of a $\beta$-barrel arrangement that we named $\beta$-barrel pore-forming A$\beta$42 oligomers ($\beta$PFOsA$\beta$42 ). Because A$\beta$42, relative to A$\beta$40, has a more prominent role in AD, the higher propensity of A$\beta$42 to form $\beta$PFOs constitutes an indication of their relevance in AD. Moreover, because $\beta$PFOsA$\beta$42 adopt a specific structure, this property offers an unprecedented opportunity for testing a hypothesis regarding the involvement of $\beta$PFOs and, more generally, membrane-associated A$\beta$ oligomers in AD.},

abstract = {X-ray lasers may allow structural studies on single particles and biomolecules without crystalline periodicity in the samples. We examine here the effect of sample dynamics as a source of structural heterogeneity on the resolution of the reconstructed image of a small protein molecule. Structures from molecular-dynamics simulations of lysozyme were sampled and aligned. These structures were then used to calculate diffraction patterns corresponding to different dynamic states. The patterns were incoherently summed and the resulting data set was phased using the oversampling method. Reconstructed images of hydrated and dehydrated lysozyme gave resolutions of 3.7 {\AA} and 7.6 {\AA}, respectively. These are significantly worse than the root-mean-square deviation of the hydrated (2.7 {\AA} for all atoms and 1.45 {\AA} for C-$\alpha$ positions) or dehydrated (3.7 {\AA} for all atoms and 2.5 {\AA} for C-$\alpha$ positions) structures. The noise introduced by structural dynamics and incoherent addition of dissimilar structures restricts the maximum resolution to be expected from direct image reconstruction of dynamic systems. A way of potentially reducing this effect is by grouping dynamic structures into distinct structural substates and solving them separately. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {A sensitive membrane filter assay for the lac repressor-operator complex has been used to study the kinetics of repressor and operator interaction. The rate of dissociation of the complex is very slow and follows first-order kinetics with a half-life of 19 minutes in our standard buffer (0.05 m ionic strength). The rate of dissociation (kb) is rather insensitive to temperature or pH, but becomes more rapid at high ionic strength. In 0.2 m ionic strength buffer the dissociation half-life is five to six minutes. The rate of association of repressor and operator is very fast and follows second-order kinetics with the rate constant for association (ka) being 7 × 109m-1sec-1in our standard buffer. The rate of association is only slightly affected by temperature or pH, but becomes slower with increasing ionic strength. It is concluded that the association of repressor and operator is aided by electrostatic attraction between the phosphate groups of DNA and a positively charged binding site on the lac repressor. Over a wide range of ionic strength, the ratio kbkahas been found to agree well with the equilibrium constant. The binding of repressor to operator results in an unfavorable enthalpy change; the driving force for the binding reaction comes from a large entropy increase. Binding mechanisms are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1969.},

abstract = {Phage therapy is the application of bacteria-specific viruses with the goal of reducing or eliminating pathogenic or nuisance bacteria. While phage therapy has become a broadly relevant technology, including veterinary, agricultural, and food microbiology applications, it is for the treatment or prevention of human infections that phage therapy first caught the world's imagination--see, especially, Arrowsmith by Sinclair Lewis (1925)--and which today is the primary motivator of the field. Nonetheless, though the first human phage therapy took place in the 1920s, by the 1940s the field, was in steep decline despite early promise. The causes were at least three-fold: insufficient understanding among researchers of basic phage biology; over exuberance, which led, along with ignorance, to carelessness; and the advent of antibiotics, an easier to handle as well as highly powerful category of antibacterials. The decline in phage therapy was neither uniform nor complete, especially in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia, where phage therapy traditions and practice continue to this day. In this review we strive toward three goals: 1. To provide an overview of the potential of phage therapy as a means of treating or preventing human diseases; 2. To explore the phage therapy state of the art as currently practiced by physicians in various pockets of phage therapy activity around the world, including in terms of potential commercialization; and 3. To avert a recapitulation of phage therapy's early decline by outlining good practices in phage therapy practice, experimentation, and, ultimately, commercialization.},

We genetically modified the $\lambda$-receptor placing a biotin on an extracellular site of the receptor in vivo. The efficiency of this in vivo biotinylation is very low, thus enabling the attachment of a streptavidin-coated bead binding specifically to a single biotinylated $\lambda$-receptor. The bead was used as a handle for the optical tweezers and as a marker for the single particle tracking routine. We propose a model that allows extraction of the motion of the protein from measurements of the mobility of the bead-molecule complex; these results are equally applicable to analyze bead-protein complexes in other membrane systems. Within a domain of radius ≃25 nm, the receptor diffuses with a diffusion constant of (1.5 ± 1.0) x 10-9 cm2/s and sits in a harmonic potential as if it were tethered by an elastic spring of spring constant of ∼1.0 x 10-2 pN/nm to the bacterial membrane.

To monitor the infection of Escherichia coli cells by light microscopy, we developed procedures for the tagging of mature bacteriophages with quantum dots. Surprisingly, most of the infecting phages were found attached to the bacterial poles. This was true for a number of temperate and virulent phages of E. coli that use widely different receptors and for phages infecting Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Vibrio cholerae. The infecting phages colocalized with the polar protein marker IcsA-GFP. ManY, an E. coli protein that is required for phage lambda DNA injection, was found to localize to the bacterial poles as well. Furthermore, labelling of lambda DNA during infection revealed that it is injected and replicated at the polar region of infection. The evolutionary benefits that lead to this remarkable preference for polar infections may be related to lambda's developmental decision as well as to the function of poles in the ability of bacterial cells to communicate with their environment and in gene regulation.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is characterized by the aggregation of beta-amyloid (A$\beta$) and tau in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. It has been found that a synergistic relationship between these two proteins may contribute to their roles in disease progression. However, how A$\beta$ and tau interact has not been fully characterized. Here, we analyze how tau seeding or aggregation is influenced by different A$\beta$ self-assemblies (fibrils and oligomers). Our cellular assays utilizing tau biosensor cells show that transduction of A$\beta$ oligomers into the cells greatly enhances seeded tau aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, transduced A$\beta$ fibrils slightly reduce tau seeding while untransduced A$\beta$ fibrils promote it. We also observe that the transduction of $\alpha$-synuclein fibrils, another amyloid protein, has no effect on tau seeding. The enhancement of tau seeding by A$\beta$ oligomers was confirmed using tau fibril seeds derived from both recombinant tau and PS19 mouse brain extracts containing human tau. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the specific form and cellular location of A$\beta$ self-assembly when studying the relationship between A$\beta$ and tau in future AD therapeutic development.},

abstract = {Optical studies have revealed that, after binding, virions move laterally on the plasma membrane, but the complexity of the cellular environment and the drawbacks of fluorescence microscopy have prevented access to the molecular dynamics of early virus-host couplings, which are important for cell infection. Here we present a colocalization methodology that combines scattering interferometry and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to visualize both position and orientation of single quantum dot-labeled Simian virus 40 (SV40) particles. By achieving nanometer spatial and 8 ms temporal resolution, we observed sliding and tumbling motions during rapid lateral diffusion on supported lipid bilayers, and repeated back and forth rocking between nanoscopic regions separated by 9 nm. Our findings suggest recurrent swap of receptors and viral pentamers as well as receptor aggregation in nanodomains. We discuss the prospects of our technique for studying virus-membrane interactions and for resolving nanoscopic dynamics of individual biological nano-objects.},

The simultaneous 2-fold improvement in the radial direction rendered a nearly spherical fluorescence spot with a diameter of 90-110 nm. The spot volume of down to 0.67 attoliters is 18 times smaller than that of confocal microscopy, thus making our results also relevant to three-dimensional photochemistry and single molecule spectroscopy.

abstract = {The neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by hyperphosphorylated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) plaques. A$\beta$ plaques are hypothesized to follow a development sequence starting with diffuse plaques, which evolve into more compact plaques and finally mature into the classic cored plaque type. A better molecular understanding of A$\beta$ pathology is crucial, as the role of A$\beta$ plaques in AD pathogenesis is under debate. Here, we studied the deposition and fibrillation of A$\beta$ in different plaque types with label-free infrared and Raman imaging. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman imaging was performed on native snap-frozen brain tissue sections from AD cases and non-demented control cases. Subsequently, the scanned tissue was stained against A$\beta$ and annotated for the different plaque types by an AD neuropathology expert. In total, 160 plaques (68 diffuse, 32 compact, and 60 classic cored plaques) were imaged with FTIR and the results of selected plaques were verified with Raman imaging. In diffuse plaques, we detect evidence of short antiparallel $\beta$-sheets, suggesting the presence of A$\beta$ oligomers. A$\beta$ fibrillation significantly increases alongside the proposed plaque development sequence. In classic cored plaques, we spatially resolve cores containing predominantly large parallel $\beta$-sheets, indicating A$\beta$ fibrils. Combining label-free vibrational imaging and immunohistochemistry on brain tissue samples of AD and non-demented cases provides novel insight into the spatial distribution of the A$\beta$ conformations in different plaque types. This way, we reconstruct the development process of A$\beta$ plaques in human brain tissue, provide insight into A$\beta$ fibrillation in the brain, and support the plaque development hypothesis.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is an increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder whose pathogenesis has been associated with aggregation of the amyloid-$\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$42). Recent studies have revealed that once A$\beta$42 fibrils are generated, their surfaces effectively catalyze the formation of neurotoxic oligomers. Here we show that a molecular chaperone, a human Brichos domain, can specifically inhibit this catalytic cycle and limit human A$\beta$42 toxicity. We demonstrate in vitro that Brichos achieves this inhibition by binding to the surfaces of fibrils, thereby redirecting the aggregation reaction to a pathway that involves minimal formation of toxic oligomeric intermediates. We verify that this mechanism occurs in living mouse brain tissue by cytotoxicity and electrophysiology experiments. These results reveal that molecular chaperones can help maintain protein homeostasis by selectively suppressing critical microscopic steps within the complex reaction pathways responsible for the toxic effects of protein misfolding and aggregation.},

It allows ultrabroadband optical (0.5–3000 µm) nanoimaging, and nanospectroscopy with fine spatial ({\textless}10 nm), spectral ({\textless}1 cm−1), and temporal ({\textless}10 fs) resolution. The history of s-SNOM is briefly introduced and recent advances which broaden the horizons of this technique in novel material research are summarized. In particular, this includes the pioneering efforts to study the nanoscale electrodynamic properties of plasmonic metamaterials, strongly correlated quantum materials, and polaritonic systems at room or cryogenic temperatures. Technical details, theoretical modeling, and new experimental methods are also discussed extensively, aiming to identify clear technology trends and unsolved challenges in this exciting field of research.},

abstract = {The " Arab Spring " uprisings of 2011 triggered a wide set of social movements and regime change across the Middle East and North Africa. While interconnected, uprisings in each nation took different forms and reached varied effects. This paper focuses on the development of conflict in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi and Syria under Bashar al-Assad in order to flesh out distinctions and interactions between uprisings, revolution, and civil war. My research first standardizes a conceptual definition of civil war from a long-standing scholarly debate. The presence or absence of civil war is examined in correlation to five specific independent variables drawn from the cases and past examinations of civil war: the nature of the governmental regime, territoriality of the conflict, militarization of the opposing sides, international influence, and regional players. Using Mill's methods and qualitative analysis of field reports, media briefings, and political rhetoric, I find that the full presence of each of these independent variables accounts for civil war in the Libyan case. In the Syrian case, incomplete presence of the five independent variables has, for the moment, prevented full-fledged civil war. The research thus allows for a more complete understanding of what constitutes civil war and provides a framework for conflict analysis as Arab Spring movements develop.},

Here, we studied the effects on A$\beta$ aggregation of DOPAL, a reactive catecholaldehyde intermediate of dopamine metabolism. We found that DOPAL is able to stabilize A$\beta$ oligomeric species, including dimers and trimers, that exert toxic effects on human neuroblastoma cells, in particular increasing cytosolic calcium levels and promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species.

abstract = {Typically, models of bacteriophage adsorption consider the process in two steps: reversible and irreversible attachment. In this study, a recently introduced one-step adsorption model, the adsorption efficiency model, is used to describe the adsorption of T-series bacteriophages to Escherichia coli. The adsorption efficiency model simplifies phage attachment to a single step: irreversible binding. The adsorption efficiency (e{\{}open{\}}) is used to account for unadsorbed phages. The model accurately describes T-series phage adsorption (T2, T4, T5, T6, and T7) under a variety of conditions. In addition, the model is compared to a commonly used two-step adsorption model, the sequential model. Experimental data support the assumptions of the adsorption efficiency model and suggest that the reversible first step of T-series phage adsorption is equivalent to irreversible attachment under the conditions tested. The adsorption efficiency model was not appropriate for a phage $\lambda$ strain lacking side tail fibers. However, the model did agree with data previously published for a strain of phage $\lambda$ possessing side tail fibers, as is the case of all T-series strains tested. This suggests that the adsorption efficiency model applies to phages containing side tail fibers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic approach regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process which is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the reaction-rate equations); the stochastic approach regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process which is governed by a single dif- ferential-difference equation (the master equation). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this stochastic simulation algorithm correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by finite time steps At. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

After assessment of more than 200 CSF specimens from Japanese and Australian patients, we found no instance of a false positive, and more than 80{\%} accuracy for the correct diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). Furthermore, the RT-QUIC can be applied to other prion diseases, including scrapie, chronic wasting disease (CWD) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and is able to quantify prion seeding activity when combined with an end-point dilution of samples. These results indicate that the RT-QUIC, with its high sensitivity and specificity, will be of great use as an early, rapid and specific assay for prion diseases. {\textcopyright} 2011 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous catalytic reactions exhibit under certain conditions kinetic oscillations which have been investigated both with polycrystalline materials and with single crystal surfaces as catalysts. The present paper reviews single-crystal experiments conducted under isothermal, low pressure conditions (p {\textless} 10-3 mbar). Two different reaction systems have been investigated: catalytic CO oxidation on various Pt and Pd orientations and catalytic NO reduction on Pt(100) using CO, H2, or NH3 as the reducing agent. The different reaction systems exhibit a wide variety of interesting phenomena which are well-known in nonlinear dynamics, for example, such as spatiotemporal pattern formation, the existence of Turing structures and the appearance of deterministic chaos, and chemical turbulence. The mechanistic steps leading to the observed phenomena have been investigated and appropriate mathematical models have been formulated and analyzed using bifurcation theory. The driving force for the rate oscillations has been shown to result from structural changes of the substrate in the case of catalytic CO oxidation on Pt surfaces, subsurface oxygen formation in the case of catalytic CO oxidation on Pd surfaces, and in the chemical reaction network described by a vacancy model in the case of the NO reduction reactions. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

In the present study, the formation of large amounts of CO2 and the depletion of CO at the hyperactive state on both Pd(100) and polycrystalline Pd foil were evidenced by the infrared intensities of the gas phase CO2 and CO, respectively. The active surfaces at the hyperactive state for palladium were characterized using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS, 450−4000 cm−1) under the realistic catalytic reaction condition. Palladium oxide on a Pd(100) surface was reduced eventually by CO at 450 K, and also under CO oxidation conditions at 450 K.

abstract = {Super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) routinely performs image reconstruction in the frequency domain using an approach termed frequency-domain reconstruction (FDR). Due to multiple Fourier transforms between the spatial and frequency domains, SIM suffers from low reconstruction speed, constraining its applications in real-time, dynamic imaging. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new method for SIM image reconstruction, termed spatial domain reconstruction (SDR). SDR is intrinsically simpler than FDR, does not require Fourier transforms and the theory predicts it to be a rapid image reconstruction method. Results show that SDR reconstructs a super-resolution image 7-fold faster than FDR, producing images that are equal to either FDR or the widely-used FairSIM. We provide a proof-of-principle using mobile fluorescent beads to demonstrate the utility of SDR in imaging moving objects. Consequently, replacement of the FDR approach with SDR significantly enhances SIM as the desired method for live-cell, instant super-resolution imaging. This means that SDR-SIM is a {\&}{\#}x201C;What You See Is What You Get{\&}{\#}x201D; approach to super-resolution imaging.},

abstract = {Fibrils associated with amyloid disease are molecular assemblies of key biological importance, yet how cells respond to the presence of amyloid remains unclear. Cellular responses may not only depend on the chemical composition or molecular properties of the amyloid fibrils, but their physical attributes such as length, width, or surface area may also play important roles. Here, we report a systematic investigation of the effect of fragmentation on the structural and biological properties of amyloid fibrils. In addition to the expected relationship between fragmentation and the ability to seed, we show a striking finding that fibril length correlates with the ability to disrupt membranes and to reduce cell viability. Thus, despite otherwise unchanged molecular architecture, shorter fibrillar samples show enhanced cytotoxic potential than their longer counterparts. The results highlight the importance of fibril length in amyloid disease, with fragmentation not only providing a mechanism by which fibril load can be rapidly increased but also creating fibrillar species of different dimensions that can endow new or enhanced biological properties such as amyloid cytotoxicity. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

Here, we have analysed and compared the structures of the filaments formed by dGAE in vitro with those deposited in the brains of individuals diagnosed with AD. We show that dGAE forms PHFs that share a macromolecular structure similar to those found in brain tissue.

It observes how the recourse to force by the US-led military coalition fighting against the so-called Islamic State (IS, also known as ISIL, or Da'esh) in Iraq and Syria seems to fit into a broader trend of increased parliamentary control over war-and-peace decisions on both sides of the Atlantic. Inasmuch as international legal arguments can and do play a role in parliamentary debates and concomitant resolutions, this trend carries the potential of contributing to the compliance pull of the jus ad bellum. Against this background, the article explores to what extent newfound war powers on the part of national parliaments go hand in hand with recourse to international legal arguments. The article engages this question through an analysis of the dialogue between the executive and legislative branches in a number of countries (in particular Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada) pertaining to the participation in the US-led coalition against IS.},

Whereas the mechanisms coordinating the segregation of the genome are well known, the processes that ensure organelle segregation between daughter cells remain less well understood1. Here we identify multiple actin assemblies with distinct but complementary roles in mitochondrial organization and inheritance in mitosis. First, we find a dense meshwork of subcortical actin cables assembled throughout the mitotic cytoplasm. This network scaffolds the endoplasmic reticulum and organizes three-dimensional mitochondrial positioning to ensure the equal segregation of mitochondrial mass at cytokinesis. Second, we identify a dynamic wave of actin filaments reversibly assembling on the surface of mitochondria during mitosis. Mitochondria sampled by this wave are enveloped within actin clouds that can spontaneously break symmetry to form elongated comet tails. Mitochondrial comet tails promote randomly directed bursts of movement that shuffle mitochondrial position within the mother cell to randomize inheritance of healthy and damaged mitochondria between daughter cells. Thus, parallel mechanisms mediated by the actin cytoskeleton ensure both equal and random inheritance of mitochondria in symmetrically dividing cells.},

We provide a guide of the spatio-temporal scale of each technique as well as highlighting novel probes and labels that have the potential to provide insights into membrane and cytoskeletal dynamics.

The rotating-polarizer method was used to separate the optical effects of transmission, linear birefringence, extinction, linear dichroism, and orientation of the electric dipole transition moments and to display them as false-color maps. These effects are typically convolved in an ordinary polarized light microscope. In this way, we show that the amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease plaques contain structurally disordered centers, providing clues to mechanisms of crystallization of amyloid in vivo. Comparisons are made with plaques from tissues of subjects having Down's syndrome and a prion disease. In plaques characteristic of each disease, the Congo red molecules are oriented radially. The optical orientation in amyloid deposited in blood vessels from subjects having cerebral amyloid angiopathy was 90° out of phase from that in the plaques, suggesting that the fibrils run tangentially with respect to the circumference of the blood vessels. Our result supports an early model in which Congo red molecules are aligned along the long fiber axis and is in contrast to the most recent binding models that are based on computation. This investigation illustrates that the latest methods for the optical analysis of heterogeneous substances are useful for in situ study of amyloid.},

A$\beta$(1-42) is the more neurotoxic species, aggregates much faster, and dominates in senile plaque of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Although small A$\beta$ oligomers are believed to be the neurotoxic species, A$\beta$ amyloid fibrils are, because of their presence in plaques, a pathological hallmark of AD and appear to play an important role in disease progression through cell-to-cell transmissibility. Here, we solved the 3D structure of a disease-relevant A$\beta$(1-42) fibril polymorph, combining data from solid-state NMR spectroscopy and mass-per-length measurements from EM.

abstract = {DNA structural transitions facilitate genomic processes, mediate drug-DNA interactions, and inform the development of emerging DNA-based biotechnology such as programmable materials and DNA origami. While some features of DNA conformational changes are well characterized, fundamental information such as the orientations of the DNA base pairs is unknown. Here, we use concurrent fluorescence polarization imaging and DNA manipulation experiments to probe the structure of S-DNA, an elusive, elongated conformation that can be accessed by mechanical overstretching. To this end, we directly quantify the orientations and rotational dynamics of fluorescent DNA-intercalated dyes. At extensions beyond the DNA overstretching transition, intercalators adopt a tilted (q {\~{}} 54°) orientation relative to the DNA axis, distinct from the nearly perpendicular orientation (q {\~{}} 90°) normally assumed at lower extensions. These results provide the first experimental evidence that S-DNA has substantially inclined base pairs relative to those of the standard (Watson-Crick) B-DNA conformation.},

The algorithm combines a maximization step (M) of the intensity's likelihood function, with expansion (E) and compression (C) steps that map the 3D intensity model to a redundant tomographic representation and back again. After a few iterations of the EMC update rule, the reconstructed intensity is given to the difference-map algorithm for reconstruction of the particle contrast. We demonstrate reconstructions with simulated data and investigate the effects of particle complexity, number of measurements, and the number of photons per measurement. The relatively transparent scaling behavior of our algorithm provides an estimate of the data processing resources required for future single-particle imaging experiments. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

How and when it originated remains contentious. Here, we report the oldest direct evidence of Yersinia pestis identified by ancient DNA in human teeth from Asia and Europe dating from 2,800 to 5,000 years ago. By sequencing the genomes, we find that these ancient plague strains are basal to all known Yersinia pestis. We find the origins of the Yersinia pestis lineage to be at least two times older than previous estimates. We also identify a temporal sequence of genetic changes that lead to increased virulence and the emergence of the bubonic plague. Our results show that plague infection was endemic in the human populations of Eurasia at least 3,000 years before any historical recordings of pandemics.},

How the amyloid state, a state accessible to all proteins and peptides, can be exploited for functional purposes but also have detrimental effects remains to be determined. Here, we measure the nanomechanical properties of different amyloids and link them to features found in their structure models. Specifically, we use shape fluctuation analysis and sonication-induced scission in combination with full-atom molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that the amyloid fibrils of the mammalian prion protein PrP are mechanically unstable, most likely due to a very low hydrogen bond density in the fibril structure. Interestingly, amyloid fibrils formed by HET-s, a fungal protein that can confer functional prion behavior, have a much higher Young's modulus and tensile strength than those of PrP, i.e., they are much stiffer and stronger due to a tighter packing in the fibril structure. By contrast, amyloids of the proteins RIP1/RIP3 that have been shown to be of functional use in human cells are significantly stiffer than PrP fibrils but have comparable tensile strength. Our study demonstrates that amyloids are biomaterials with a broad range of nanomechanical properties, and we provide further support for the strong link between nanomechanics and $\beta$-sheet characteristics in the amyloid core.},

abstract = {Far-field optical microscopy using focused light is an important tool in a number of scientific disciplines including chemical, (bio)physical and biomedical research, particularly with respect to the study of living cells and organisms. Unfortunately, the applicability of the optical microscope is limited, since the diffraction of light imposes limitations on the spatial resolution of the image. Consequently the details of, for example, cellular protein distributions, can be visualized only to a certain extent. Fortunately, recent years have witnessed the development of 'super-resolution' far-field optical microscopy (nanoscopy) techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED), ground state depletion (GSD), reversible saturated optical (fluorescence) transitions (RESOLFT), photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), structured illumination microscopy (SIM) or saturated structured illumination microscopy (SSIM), all in one way or another addressing the problem of the limited spatial resolution of far-field optical microscopy. While SIM achieves a two-fold improvement in spatial resolution compared to conventional optical microscopy, STED, RESOLFT, PALM/STORM, or SSIM have all gone beyond, pushing the limits of optical image resolution to the nanometer scale. Consequently, all super-resolution techniques open new avenues of biomedical research. Because the field is so young, the potential capabilities of different super-resolution microscopy approaches have yet to be fully explored, and uncertainties remain when considering the best choice of methodology. Thus, even for experts, the road to the future is sometimes shrouded in mist. The super-resolution optical microscopy roadmap of Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics addresses this need for clarity. It provides guidance to the outstanding questions through a collection of short review articles from experts in the field, giving a thorough discussion on the concepts underlying super-resolution optical microscopy, the potential of different approaches, the importance of label optimization (such as reversible photoswitchable proteins) and applications in which these methods will have a significant impact.

abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with inflammation. AF patients have elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines known to promote vascular leak, such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF). However, the contribution of vascular leak and consequent cardiac edema to the genesis of atrial arrhythmias remains unknown. Previous work suggests that interstitial edema in the heart can acutely promote ventricular arrhythmias by disrupting ventricular myocyte intercalated disk (ID) nanodomains rich in cardiac sodium channels (NaV1.5) and slowing cardiac conduction. Interestingly, similar disruption of ID nanodomains has been identified in atrial samples from AF patients. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that VEGF-induced vascular leak can acutely increase atrial arrhythmia susceptibility by disrupting ID nanodomains and slowing atrial conduction. Treatment of murine hearts with VEGF (30–60 min, at clinically relevant levels) prolonged the electrocardiographic P wave and increased susceptibility to burst pacing-induced atrial arrhythmias. Optical voltage mapping revealed slower atrial conduction following VEGF treatment (10 ± 0.4 cm/s vs. 21 ± 1 cm/s at baseline, p {\textless} 0.05). Transmission electron microscopy revealed increased intermembrane spacing at ID sites adjacent to gap junctions (GJs; 64 ± 9 nm versus 17 ± 1 nm in controls, p {\textless} 0.05), as well as sites next to mechanical junctions (MJs; 63 ± 4 nm versus 27 ± 2 nm in controls, p {\textless} 0.05) in VEGF–treated hearts relative to controls. Importantly, super-resolution microscopy and quantitative image analysis revealed reorganization of NaV1.5 away from dense clusters localized near GJs and MJs to a more diffuse distribution throughout the ID. Taken together, these data suggest that VEGF can acutely predispose otherwise normal hearts to atrial arrhythmias by dynamically disrupting NaV1.5-rich ID nanodomains and slowing atrial conduction. These data highlight inflammation-induced vascular leak as a potential factor in the development and progression of AF.},

Multicolor super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques have been developed to achieve this goal, yet challenges remain in terms of the number of targets that can be simultaneously imaged and the crosstalk between color channels. Herein, we demonstrate multicolor stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) based on a multi-parameter detection strategy, which uses both the fluorescence activation wavelength and the emission color to discriminate between photo-activatable fluorescent probes. First, we obtained two-color super-resolution images using the near-infrared cyanine dye Alexa 750 in conjunction with a red cyanine dye Alexa 647, and quantified color crosstalk levels and image registration accuracy. Combinatorial pairing of these two switchable dyes with fluorophores which enhance photo-activation enabled multi-parameter detection of six different probes. Using this approach, we obtained six-color super-resolution fluorescence images of a model sample. The combination of multiple fluorescence detection parameters for improved fluorophore discrimination promises to substantially enhance our ability to visualize multiple cellular targets with sub-diffraction-limit resolution.

In this report, we examine human and mouse cell lines containing different BRCA2 mutations for their ability to repair chromosomal breaks by homologous recombination. Using the I-SceI endonuclease to introduce a double-strand break at a specific chromosomal locus, we find that BRCA2 mutant cell lines are recombination deficient, such that homology-directed repair is reduced 6- to {\textgreater}100-fold, depending on the cell line. Thus, BRCA2 is essential for efficient homology-directed repair, presumably in conjunction with the Rad51 recombinase.

In this study, a cellular vertex model is developed to investigate the collective dynamics of a disk-like aggregate of cancer cells confined in a confluent monolayer of normal cells. The effects of intercellular adhesion and cell motility on tumor progression are examined. It is found that the stresses in both the cancer cells and the normal cells increase with tumor growth, resulting in a crowded environment and enhanced cell apoptosis. The intercellular adhesion between cancer cells and normal cells is revealed to promote tumor growth and invasion. The tumor invasion dynamics hinges on the motility of cancer cells. The cancer cells could orchestrate into different collective migration modes, e.g., directional migration and rotational oscillations, dictated by the competition between cell persistence and local coordination. Phase diagrams are established to reveal the competitive mechanisms. This work highlights the role of mechanics in regulating tumor growth and invasion.},

abstract = {In this minireview we have attempted to provide some overall perspective on the question of how various forms of diffusion in reduced dimensions, or diffusion within a nonspecifically bound state, can speed biological interactions beyond the limits normally set by three-dimensional diffusion processes. To this end we began by discussing the rates expected for small molecules engaged in classical elastic collisions. We then proceeded to modify this picture by introducing first the features of inelastic macromolecular collisions in solution, then the effects of specific electrostatic fields set up around macromolecules of known structure at low ionic strengths, and finally the special rate enhancements available to DNA-protein interactions because of the particular geometry of the DNA molecule and the multiple conformations that can be assumed by the protein component. We hope that this exposition will help to clarify the subject for others and also will stimulate more focused examination of this type of problem, both in DNA-protein interaction systems and in other biological systems where such rate facilitation might apply.},

abstract = {There has been an explosion in the number of papers discussing the hypothesis of 'pathogenic spread' in neurodegenerative disease-the idea that abnormal forms of disease-associated proteins, such as tau or $\alpha$-synuclein, physically move from neuron to neuron to induce disease progression. However, whether inter-neuronal spread of protein aggregates actually occurs in humans and, if so, whether it causes symptom onset remain uncertain. Even if pathogenic spread is proven in humans, it is unclear how much this would alter the specific therapeutic approaches that are in development. A critical appraisal of this increasingly popular hypothesis thus seems both important and timely.},

abstract = {Reducing levels of the aggregation-prone A$\beta$ peptide that accumulates in the brain with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been a major target of experimental therapies. An alternative approach may be to stabilize the physiological conformation of A$\beta$. To date, the physiological state of A$\beta$ in brain remains unclear, since the available methods used to process brain tissue for determination of A$\beta$ aggregate conformation can in themselves alter the structure and/or composition of the aggregates. Here, using synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy, non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and conformational specific antibodies we show that the physiological conformations of A$\beta$ and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in brain of transgenic mouse models of AD are altered before formation of amyloid plaques. Furthermore, focal A$\beta$ aggregates in brain that precede amyloid plaque formation localize to synaptic terminals. These changes in the states of A$\beta$ and APP that occur prior to plaque formation may provide novel targets for AD therapy.},

abstract = {The extracellular deposition of $\beta$‐amyloid (A$\beta$) is one of the major characteristics in Alz-heimer´s disease (AD). The”spreading hypothesis” suggests that a pathological protein (similar to prions) spreads over the entire brain. The aim of the present study was to use organotypic brain slices of postnatal day 8–10 mice. Using collagen hydrogels, we applied different A$\beta$ peptides onto brain slices and analyzed spreading as well as glial reactions after eight weeks of incubation. Our data showed that from all tested A$\beta$ peptides, human A$\beta$42 had the most potent activity to spread over into adjacent”target“ areas. This effect was potentiated when brain slices from transgenic AD mice (APP{\_}SweDI) were cultured. When different brain areas were connected to the”target slice“ the spreading activity was more intense, originating from ventral striatum and brain stem. Reactive glial‐fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrogliosis increased over time, but A$\beta$ depositions co‐local-ized only with Iba1+ microglia but not with astrocytes. Application of human A$\beta$42 did not cause a degeneration of cholinergic neurons. We concluded that human A$\beta$42 spreads over into other”target areas“, causing activation of glial cells. Most of the spread A$\beta$42 was taken up by microglia, and thus toxic free A$\beta$ could not damage cholinergic neurons.},

abstract = {The aggregation and deposition of tau is a hallmark of a class of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies. Despite intensive study, cellular and molecular factors that trigger tau aggregation are not well understood. Here, we provide evidence for two mechanisms relevant to the initiation of tau aggregation in the presence of cytoplasmic polyphosphates (polyP): changes in the conformational ensemble of monomer tau and noncovalent cross-linking of multiple tau monomers. We identified conformational changes throughout full-length tau, most notably diminishment of long-range interactions between the termini coupled with compaction of the microtubule binding and proline- rich regions. We found that while the proline-rich and microtubule binding regions both contain polyP binding sites, the proline-rich region is a requisite for compaction of the microtubule binding region upon binding. Additionally, both the magnitude of the conformational change and the aggregation of tau are dependent on the chain length of the polyP polymer. Longer polyP chains are more effective at intermolecular, noncovalent cross-linking of tau. These observations provide an understanding of the initial steps of tau aggregation through interaction with a physiologically relevant aggregation inducer.},

abstract = {The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, causing intractable infections, has resulted in an increased interest in phage therapy. Phage therapy preceded antibiotic treatment against bacterial infections and involves the use of bacteriophages, bacterial viruses, to fight bacteria. Virulent phages are abundant and have proven to be very effective in vitro, where they in most cases lyse any bacteria within the hour. Clinical trials on animals and humans show promising results but also that the treatments are not completely effective. This is partly due to the studies being carried out with few phages, and with limited experimental groups, but also the fact that phage therapy has limitations in vivo. Phages are large compared with small antibiotic molecules, and each phage can only infect one or a few bacterial strains. A very large number of different phages are needed to treat infections as these are caused by genetically different strains of bacteria. Phages are effective only if enough of them can reach the bacteria and increase in number in situ. Taken together, this entails high demands on resources for the construction of phage libraries and the testing of individual phages. The effectiveness and host range must be characterized, and immunological risks must be assessed for every single phage.},

Charged polyelectrolytes such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are frequently found associated with the proteinaceous deposits in tissues of patients affected by amyloid diseases. Experimental evidence indicate that they can play an active role in favoring amyloid fibril formation and stabilization. Binding of GAGs to amyloid fibrils occurs mainly through electrostatic interactions involving the negative polyelectrolyte charges and positively charged side chains residues of aggregating protein. Similarly to catalyst for reactions, GAGs favor aggregation, nucleation and amyloid fibril formation functioning as a structural templates for the self-assembly of highly cytotoxic oligomeric precursors, rich in $\beta$-sheets, into harmless amyloid fibrils. Moreover, the GAGs amyloid promoting activity can be facilitated through specific interactions via consensus binding sites between amyloid polypeptide and GAGs molecules. We review the effect of GAGs on amyloid deposition as well as proteins not strictly related to diseases. In addition, we consider the potential of the GAGs therapy in amyloidosis.},

abstract = {Importance: Limited information about the relationship between specific mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) and cancer risk exists.Objective: To identify mutation-specific cancer risks for carriers of BRCA1/2.Design, Setting, and Participants: Observational study of women who were ascertained between 1937 and 2011 (median, 1999) and found to carry disease-associated BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. The international sample comprised 19,581 carriers of BRCA1 mutations and 11,900 carriers of BRCA2 mutations from 55 centers in 33 countries on 6 continents. We estimated hazard ratios for breast and ovarian cancer based on mutation type, function, and nucleotide position. We also estimated RHR, the ratio of breast vs ovarian cancer hazard ratios. A value of RHR greater than 1 indicated elevated breast cancer risk; a value of RHR less than 1 indicated elevated ovarian cancer risk.Exposures: Mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2.Main Outcomes and Measures: Breast and ovarian cancer risks.Results: Among BRCA1 mutation carriers, 9052 women (46{\%}) were diagnosed with breast cancer, 2317 (12{\%}) with ovarian cancer, 1041 (5{\%}) with breast and ovarian cancer, and 7171 (37{\%}) without cancer. Among BRCA2 mutation carriers, 6180 women (52{\%}) were diagnosed with breast cancer, 682 (6{\%}) with ovarian cancer, 272 (2{\%}) with breast and ovarian cancer, and 4766 (40{\%}) without cancer. In BRCA1, we identified 3 breast cancer cluster regions (BCCRs) located at c.179 to c.505 (BCCR1; RHR = 1.46; 95{\%} CI, 1.22-1.74; P = 2 × 10(-6)), c.4328 to c.4945 (BCCR2; RHR = 1.34; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-1.78; P = .04), and c. 5261 to c.5563 (BCCR2', RHR = 1.38; 95{\%} CI, 1.22-1.55; P = 6 × 10(-9)). We also identified an ovarian cancer cluster region (OCCR) from c.1380 to c.4062 (approximately exon 11) with RHR = 0.62 (95{\%} CI, 0.56-0.70; P = 9 × 10(-17)). In BRCA2, we observed multiple BCCRs spanning c.1 to c.596 (BCCR1; RHR = 1.71; 95{\%} CI, 1.06-2.78; P = .03), c.772 to c.1806 (BCCR1'; RHR = 1.63; 95{\%} CI, 1.10-2.40; P = .01), and c.7394 to c.8904 (BCCR2; RHR = 2.31; 95{\%} CI, 1.69-3.16; P = .00002). We also identified 3 OCCRs: the first (OCCR1) spanned c.3249 to c.5681 that was adjacent to c.5946delT (6174delT; RHR = 0.51; 95{\%} CI, 0.44-0.60; P = 6 × 10(-17)). The second OCCR spanned c.6645 to c.7471 (OCCR2; RHR = 0.57; 95{\%} CI, 0.41-0.80; P = .001). Mutations conferring nonsense-mediated decay were associated with differential breast or ovarian cancer risks and an earlier age of breast cancer diagnosis for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.Conclusions and Relevance: Breast and ovarian cancer risks varied by type and location of BRCA1/2 mutations. With appropriate validation, these data may have implications for risk assessment and cancer prevention decision making for carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.},

To achieve this goal, a phage virion must undergo significant structural remodeling. For phage T4, the most obvious change is the contraction of its tail. Here, we use skinny E. coli minicells as a host, along with cryo-electron tomography and mutant phage virions, to visualize key structural intermediates during initiation of T4 infection. We show for the first time that most long tail fibers are folded back against the tail sheath until irreversible adsorption, a feature compatible with the virion randomly walking across the cell surface to find an optimal site for infection. Our data confirm that tail contraction is triggered by structural changes in the baseplate, as intermediates were found with remodeled baseplates and extended tails. After contraction, the tail tube penetrates the host cell periplasm, pausing while it degrades the peptidoglycan layer. Penetration into the host cytoplasm is accompanied by a dramatic local outward curvature of the cytoplasmic membrane as it fuses with the phage tail tip. The baseplate hub protein gp27 and/or the ejected tape measure protein gp29 likely form the transmembrane channel for viral DNA passage into the cell cytoplasm. Building on the wealth of prior biochemical and structural information, this work provides new molecular insights into the mechanistic pathway of T4 phage infection.},

Here we report the chemical design of a library of anionic luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs), which can be utilized as ligands for detection of protein aggregates. Certain molecular requirements were shown to be necessary for detecting (i) early non-thioflavinophilic protein assemblies of A$\beta$1-42 and insulin preceding the formation of amyloid fibrils and (ii) for obtaining distinct spectral signatures of the two main pathological hallmarks observed in human Alzheimer's diease brain tissue (A$\beta$ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles). Our findings suggest that a superior anionic LCO-based ligand should have a backbone consisting of five to seven thiophene units and carboxyl groups extending the conjugated thiophene backbone. Such LCOs will be highly useful for studying the underlying molecular events of protein aggregation diseases and could also be utilized for the development of novel diagnostic tools for these diseases. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.},

Major developments in growth and synthesis methods mean that atoms can nowadays be manipulated in a controlled fashion to produce novel properties that are often not found in bulk materials. Techniques for locating and identifying atomic configurations within nanostructures become even more essential in the relentless drive towards realizing optimal physical behavior. In this regard, the electron microscope, with its intrinsic capacity for atomic-scale imaging and chemical analysis, has become an indispensable tool in the arsenal of the materials scientist interested in nanostructured materials.

abstract = {Biological adhesion between cells is critical for development of multicellular organisms and for the function of the adaptive immune system of vertebrates. A gap in understanding of adhesion systems arises from the difficulty of collecting quantitative data on the molecular interactions underlying adhesion, which is typically studied by population statistics such as percent adhesion in the presence of empirically defined forces to separate less adherent cells. Supported lipid bilayers formed on glass surfaces offer a useful model system in which to explore some basic features of molecular interactions in adhesive contacts. We have exploited the lateral mobility of molecules in the supported planar bilayers and fluorescence microscopy to develop a system for measurement of two-dimensional affinities and kinetic rates in contact areas. Affinity measurements are based on a modified Scatchard analysis. Measurements of kinetic rates are based on fluorescence photobleaching after recovery at the level of the entire contact area. This has been coupled to a reaction-diffusion equation that allows calculation of on- and off-rates. We have found that mixtures of ligands in supported planar bilayers can effectively activate T lymphocytes and simultaneously allow monitoring of the immunological synapse. Recent studies in planar bilayers have provided additional insights into organization principles of cell-cell interfaces. Perennial problems in understanding cell-cell communication are yielding to quantitative measurements based on planar bilayers in areas of ligand driven receptor clustering and the role of the actin cytoskeleton in immune cell activation. A major goal for the field is determining quantitative rules involved in signaling complex formation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here, we report a plasmonic nanoparticle amyloid corona (PNAC) for quantifying the efficacy of A$\beta$ oligomeric aggregate-degrading drugs. Our strategy is to monitor the drug-induced degradation of oligomeric aggregates by analyzing the colorimetric responses of PNACs. To test our strategy, we use A$\beta$-degrading proteases (protease XIV and MMP-9) and subsequently various small-molecule substances that have shown benefits in the treatment of AD. We demonstrate that this strategy with PNAC can identify effective drugs for eliminating oligomeric aggregates. Thus, this approach presents an appealing opportunity to reduce attrition problems in drug discovery for AD treatment.},

Because solid-state NMR techniques can be used to determine interatomic distances (both intramolecular and intermolecular), place constraints on backbone and side-chain torsion angles, and identify tertiary and quaternary contacts, full molecular models for amyloid fibrils can be developed from solid-state NMR data, especially when supplemented by lower-resolution structural constraints from electron microscopy and other sources. In addition, solid-state NMR data can be used as experimental tests of various proposals and hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of amyloid formation, the nature of intermediate structures, and the common structural features within amyloid fibrils. This review introduces the basic experimental and conceptual principles behind solid-state NMR methods that are applicable to amyloid fibrils, reviews the information about amyloid structures that has been obtained to date with these methods, and discusses how solid-state NMR data provide insights into the molecular interactions that stabilize amyloid structures, the generic propensity of polypeptide chains to form amyloid fibrils, and a number of related issues that are of current interest in the amyloid field. {\textcopyright} 2006 Cambridge University Press.},

The heparin-induced tau filaments differ from those of Alzheimer's or Pick's disease, which have larger cores with different repeat compositions. Our results illustrate the structural versatility of amyloid filaments, and raise questions about the relevance of in vitro assembly.},

abstract = {The coalescence of proteins into highly ordered aggregates is a hallmark of protein misfolding disorders (PMDs), which, when affecting the central nervous system, lead to progressive neurodegeneration. Although the chemical identity and the topology of each culprit protein are unique, the principles governing aggregation and propagation are strikingly stereotypical. It is now clear that such protein aggregates can spread from cell to cell and eventually affect entire organ systems - similarly to prion diseases. However, because most aggregates are not found to transmit between individuals, they are not infectious sensu strictiori. Therefore, they are not identical to prions and we prefer to define them as 'prionoids'. Here we review recent advances in understanding the toxicity of protein aggregation affecting the brain. Protein misfolding and aggregation is the root cause of many neurodegenerative disorders. Data implicate oligomeric species in the initiation and propagation of toxicity and in their own self-propagation.Although chemically disparate, toxic oligomers in various disorders activate similar downstream pathways, suggesting that a limited number of common mechanisms may lead to cytotoxicity.Pathological protein aggregates use many different cellular mechanisms to spread within organisms. Exosomes may be exploited as Trojan horses by these entities. Several nonconventional pathways may also play a role in the export of oligomeric units, including tunneling nanotubes.Pathological oligomers can use classical endocytic routes for entry into the cell. However, some oligomers may interact with the plasma membrane and gain entry through nonconventional routes.},

Very short and extremely bright, coherent X-ray pulses can be used to outrun key damage processes and obtain a single diffraction pattern from a large macromolecule, a virus or a cell before the sample explodes and turns into plasma. The continuous diffraction pattern of non-crystalline objects permits oversampling and direct phase retrieval. Here we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a non-crystalline biological sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. Calculations indicate that the energy deposited into the virus by the pulse heated the particle to over 100,000K after the pulse had left the sample. The reconstructed exit wavefront (image) yielded 32-nm full-period resolution in a single exposure and showed no measurable damage. The reconstruction indicates inhomogeneous arrangement of dense material inside the virion. We expect that significantly higher resolutions will be achieved in such experiments with shorter and brighter photon pulses focused to a smaller area. The resolution in such experiments can be further extended for samples available in multiple identical copies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: First introduced in 2006, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) has stirred great interest, as evidenced by 75 publications as of October 2015, with 56 of them just in the last 2 years. The widespread adop- tion of this isothermal molecular tool in many diagnostic fields represents an affordable (approximately 4.3 USD per test), simple (few and easy hands-on steps), fast (results within 5–20 min), and sensitive (single target copy number detected)methodfor the identification of pathogensandthe detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms in human cancers and genetically modified organisms. CONTENT: This review summarizes the current knowl- edge on RPA. The molecular diagnostics of various RNA/DNApathogens is discussed while highlighting re- cent applications in clinical settings with focus on point- of-care (POC) bioassays and on automated fluidic plat- forms. The strengths and limitations of this isothermal method are also addressed. SUMMARY: RPA is becoming a molecular tool of choice for the rapid, specific, and cost-effective identification of pathogens. Owing to minimal sample-preparation require- ments, low operation temperature (25–42 °C), and com- mercial availability of freeze-dried reagents, this method has been applied outside laboratory settings, in remote areas, and interestingly, onboard automated sample-to-answer microfluidic devices. RPA is undoubtedly a promising iso- thermal molecular technique for clinical microbiology lab- oratories and emergence response in clinical settings.},

abstract = {Self-assembly of proteins into amyloid aggregates is an important biological phenomenon associated with human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid fibrils also have potential applications in nano-engineering of biomaterials. The kinetics of amyloid assembly show an exponential growth phase preceded by a lag phase, variable in duration as seen in bulk experiments and experiments that mimic the small volumes of cells. Here, to investigate the origins and the properties of the observed variability in the lag phase of amyloid assembly currently not accounted for by deterministic nucleation dependent mechanisms, we formulate a new stochastic minimal model that is capable of describing the characteristics of amyloid growth curves despite its simplicity. We then solve the stochastic differential equations of our model and give mathematical proof of a central limit theorem for the sample growth trajectories of the nucleated aggregation process. These results give an asymptotic description for our simple model, from which closed form analytical results capable of describing and predicting the variability of nucleated amyloid assembly were derived. We also demonstrate the application of our results to inform experiments in a conceptually friendly and clear fashion. Our model offers a new perspective and paves the way for a new and efficient approach on extracting vital information regarding the key initial events of amyloid formation.},

Rather, it is intended to lay a conceptual foundation by which magnetic resonance image formation can be understood from an intuitive perspective. The presentation is nonmathematical, relying on simple models that take the reader progressively from the basic spin physics of nuclei, through descriptions of how the magnetic resonance signal is generated and detected in an MRI scanner, the foundations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation, and a discussion of the Fourier transform and its relation to MR image formation.

abstract = {The aggregation of alpha-synuclein ($\alpha$-syn) and huntingtin (htt) into fibrillar assemblies in nerve and glial cells is a molecular hallmark of Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. Within the aggregation process, prefibrillar and fibrillar oligomeric species form. Prefibrillar assemblies rather than fibrils are nowadays considered cytotoxic. However, recent reports describing spreading of fibrillar assemblies from one cell to another, in cell cultures, animal models, and brains of grafted patients suggest a critical role for fibrillar assemblies in pathogenesis. Here we compare the cytotoxic effect of defined and comparable particle concentrations of on-assembly pathway oligomeric and fibrillar $\alpha$-syn and Htt fragment corresponding to the first exon of the protein (HttEx1). We show that homogeneous populations of $\alpha$-syn and HttEx1 fibrils, rather than their precursor on-assembly pathway oligomers, are highly toxic to cultured cells and induce apoptotic cell death. We document the reasons that make fibrils toxic. We show that $\alpha$-syn and HttEx1 fibrils bind and permeabilize lipid vesicles. We also show that fibrils binding to the plasma membrane in cultured cells alter Ca 2+ homeostasis. Overall, our data indicate that fibrillar $\alpha$-syn and HttEx1, rather than their precursor oligomers, are highly cytotoxic, the toxicity being associated to their ability to bind and permeabilize the cell membranes. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The ordered assembly of amyloidogenic proteins causes a wide spectrum of common neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. These diseases share common features with prion diseases, in which misfolded proteins can self-replicate and transmit disease across different hosts. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms that underlie the amplification of aggregates is fundamental for understanding how pathological deposits can spread through the brain and drive disease. Here, we used single-molecule microscopy to study the assembly and replication of tau at the single aggregate level. We found that tau aggregates have an intrinsic ability to amplify by filament fragmentation, and determined the doubling times for this replication process by kinetic modeling. We then simulated the spreading time for aggregates through the brain and found this to be in good agreement with both the observed time frame for spreading of pathological tau deposits in Alzheimer's disease and in experimental models of tauopathies. With this work we begin to understand the physical parameters that govern the spreading rates of tau and other amyloids through the human brain.},

We aimed to investigate the relationship between diverse structural assemblies of amyloid-$\beta$ and rates of clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease. Using novel biophysical methods, we analysed levels, particle size, and conformational characteristics of amyloid-$\beta$ in the posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of 48 cases of Alzheimer's disease with distinctly different disease durations, and correlated the data with APOE gene polymorphism. In both hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex we identified an extensive array of distinct amyloid-$\beta${\textless}inf{\textgreater}42{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} particles that differ in size, display of N-terminal and C-terminal domains, and conformational stability. In contrast, amyloid-$\beta${\textless}inf{\textgreater}40{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} present at low levels did not form a major particle with discernible size, and both N-terminal and C- terminal domains were largely exposed. Rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease that is associated with a low frequency of APOE e4 allele demonstrates considerably expanded conformational heterogeneity of amyloid-$\beta${\textless}inf{\textgreater}42{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, with higher levels of distinctly structured amyloid-$\beta${\textless}inf{\textgreater}42{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} particles composed of 30-100 monomers, and fewer particles composed of {\textless} 30 monomers. The link between rapid clinical decline and levels of amyloid-$\beta${\textless}inf{\textgreater}42{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} with distinct structural characteristics suggests that different conformers may play an important role in the pathogenesis of distinct Alzheimer's disease phenotypes. These findings indicate that Alzheimer's disease exhibits a wide spectrum of amyloid-$\beta${\textless}inf{\textgreater}42{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} structural states and imply the existence of prion-like conformational strains.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease affects millions of lives worldwide. This terminal disease is characterized by the formation of amyloid aggregates, so-called amyloid oligomers. These oligomers are composed of $\beta$-sheet structures, which are believed to be neurotoxic. However, the actual secondary structure that contributes most to neurotoxicity remains unknown. This lack of knowledge is due to the challenging nature of characterizing the secondary structure of amyloids in cells. To overcome this and investigate the molecular changes in proteins directly in cells, we used synchrotron-based infrared microspectroscopy, a label-free and non-destructive technique available for in situ molecular imaging, to detect structural changes in proteins and lipids. Specifically, we evaluated the formation of $\beta$-sheet structures in different monogenic and bigenic cellular models of Alzheimer's disease that we generated for this study. We report on the possibility to discern different amyloid signatures directly in cells using infrared microspectroscopy and demonstrate that bigenic (amyloid-$\beta$, $\alpha$-synuclein) and (amyloid-$\beta$, Tau) neuron-like cells display changes in $\beta$-sheet load. Altogether, our findings support the notion that different molecular mechanisms of amyloid aggregation, as opposed to a common mechanism, are triggered by the specific cellular environment and, therefore, that various mechanisms lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease.},

The residual transmission of polarizing filters depending on the incidence angle of polarized light was examined in detail. The superior quality of polarizing film filters treated with carbon nanotubes was found. This fact allows us to propose a new application for polarizing films with carbon nanotubes for a polarizing cover glass. In such a way the cover glass may serve as an analyzer in a light polarizing microscope. Some features of optical scheme arrangement for the polarizing technique are discussed. The polarizing cover glass allows elimination of depolarization of light, which is inserted in a microscope objective. Test results of the proposed polarizing technique attest to the efficiency of using the polarizing cover glass.

Nanoscopy approaches have begun to facilitate discoveries in cell biology and to add new knowledge. One current direction for method improvement is the ambition to quantitatively account for each molecule under investigation and assess true molecular colocalization patterns via multi-colour analyses. In pursuing this goal, the labelling of individual molecules to enable their visualization has emerged as a central challenge. Extending nanoscale imaging into (sliced) tissue and whole-Animal contexts is a further goal.

Oxidiative stress and metal rich environments have been implicated in triggering assembly. Here, we have explored the composition of Lewy bodies in postmortem tissue using electron microscopy and immunogold labeling and revealed dityrosine crosslinks in Lewy bodies in brain tissue from PD patients. In vitro, we show that dityrosine cross-links in $\alpha$-syn are formed by covalent ortho-ortho coupling of two tyrosine residues under conditions of oxidative stress by fluorescence and confirmed using mass-spectrometry. A covalently cross-linked dimer isolated by SDS-PAGE and mass analysis showed that dityrosine dimer was formed via the coupling of Y39-Y39 to give a homo dimer peptide that may play a key role in formation of oligomeric and seeds for fibril formation. Atomic force microscopy analysis reveals that the covalent dityrosine contributes to the stabilization of $\alpha$-syn assemblies. Thus, the presence of oxidative stress induced dityrosine could play an important role in assembly and toxicity of $\alpha$-syn in PD.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.Background: A wide class of human diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, is due to the failure of a specific peptide or protein to keep its native functional conformational state and to undergo a conformational change into a misfolded state, triggering the formation of fibrillar cross-$\beta$ sheet amyloid aggregates. During the fibrillization, several coexisting species are formed, giving rise to a highly heterogeneous mixture. Despite its fundamental role in biological function and malfunction, the mechanism of protein self-assembly and the fundamental origins of the connection between aggregation, cellular toxicity and the biochemistry of neurodegeneration remains challenging to elucidate in molecular detail. In particular, the nature of the specific state of proteins that is most prone to cause cytotoxicity is not established. Methods: In the present review, we present the latest advances obtained by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) based techniques to unravel the biophysical properties of amyloid aggregates at the nanoscale. Unraveling amyloid single species biophysical properties still represents a formidable experimental challenge, mainly because of their nanoscale dimensions and heterogeneous nature. Bulk techniques, such as circular dichroism or infrared spectroscopy, are not able to characterize the heterogeneity and inner properties of amyloid aggregates at the single species level, preventing a profound investigation of the correlation between the biophysical properties and toxicity of the individual species. Conclusion: The information delivered by AFM based techniques could be central to study the aggregation pathway of proteins and to design molecules that could interfere with amyloid aggregation delaying the onset of misfolding diseases.},

We quantified actin filament order in human cells using fluorescence polarization microscopy and found that cleavage furrow ingression initiates by contraction of an equatorial actin network with randomly oriented filaments. The network subsequently gradually reoriented actin filaments along the cell equator. This strictly depended on myosin II activity, suggesting local network reorganization by mechanical forces. Cortical laser microsurgery revealed that during cytokinesis progression, mechanical tension increased substantially along the direction of the cell equator, while the network contracted laterally along the pole-to-pole axis without a detectable increase in tension. Our data suggest that an asymmetric increase in cortical tension promotes filament reorientation along the cytokinetic cleavage furrow, which might have implications for diverse other biological processes involving actomyosin rings.},

By overcoming this limitation via adaptations of stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, we directly measure the concentration profile of polymer solutions at a nonadsorbing wall under Poiseuille flow. Using this approach, we 1) confirm the theoretically predicted concentration profile governed by entropically driven depletion, 2) observe depletion layer narrowing at low to intermediate shear rates, and 3) report depletion layer composition that approaches pure solvent at unexpectedly low shear rates.},

abstract = {Aggregates of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, but there is no consensus as to either the nature of the toxic molecular complex or the mechanism by which toxic aggregates are produced. We report on a novel feature of amyloid-lipid interactions where discontinuities in the lipid continuum can serve as catalytic centers for a previously unseen microscale aggregation phenomenon. We show that specific lipid membrane conditions rapidly produce long contours of lipid-bound peptide, even at sub-physiological concentrations of A$\beta$. Using single molecule fluorescence, time-lapse TIRF microscopy and AFM imaging we characterize this phenomenon and identify some exceptional properties of the aggregation pathway which make it a likely contributor to early oligomer and fibril formation, and thus a potential critical mechanism in the etiology of AD. We infer that these amyloidogenic events occur only at areas of high membrane curvature, which suggests a range of possible mechanisms by which accumulated physiological changes may lead to their inception. The speed of the formation is in hours to days, even at 1 nM peptide concentrations. Lipid features of this type may act like an assembly line for monomeric and small oligomeric subunits of A$\beta$ to increase their aggregation states. We conclude that under lipid environmental conditions, where catalytic centers of the observed type are common, key pathological features of AD may arise on a very short timescale under physiological concentration.},

SUMMARY Class 2 CRISPR-Cas nucleases are programmable genome editing tools with promising applications in human health and disease. However, DNA cleavage at off-target sites that resemble the target sequence is a pervasive problem that remains poorly understood mechanistically. Here, we use quantitative kinetics to dissect the reaction steps of DNA targeting by Acidaminococcus sp Cas12a (also known as Cpf1). We show that Cas12a binds DNA tightly in two kinetically separable steps. Pro-tospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) recognition is followed by rate-limiting R-loop propagation, leading to inevitable DNA cleavage of both strands. Despite functionally irreversible binding, Cas12a discriminates strongly against mismatches along most of the DNA target sequence. This result implies substantial reversibility during R-loop formation-a late transition state-and defies common descriptions of a ''seed'' region. Our results provide a quantitative basis for the DNA cleavage patterns measured in vivo and observations of greater reported target specificity for Cas12a than for the Cas9 nuclease.},

abstract = {The misfolding and aggregation of polypeptide chains into $\beta$-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils is associated with a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases. Growing evidence indicates that the oligomeric intermediates populated in the early stages of amyloid formation rather than the mature fibrils are responsible for the cytotoxicity and pathology and are potentially therapeutic targets. However, due to the low-populated, transient, and heterogeneous nature of amyloid oligomers, they are hard to characterize by conventional bulk methods. The development of single molecule approaches provides a powerful toolkit for investigating these oligomeric intermediates as well as the complex process of amyloid aggregation at molecular resolution. In this review, we present an overview of recent progress in characterizing the oligomerization of amyloid proteins by single molecule fluorescence techniques, including single-molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), single-molecule photobleaching and super-resolution optical imaging. We discuss how these techniques have been applied to investigate the different aspects of amyloid oligomers and facilitate understanding of the mechanism of amyloid aggregation.},

The discovery of EPCs has lead to new insights in vascular repair and atherosclerosis and also a new theory for ageing. EPCs from the bone marrow and some other organs aid in vascular repair by migrating to distant vessels where they differentiate into mature endothelial cells and replace old and injured endothelial cells. The ability of EPCs to repair vascular damage depends on their number and functionality. Currently marketed drugs used in a variety of diseases can modulate these characteristics. In this review, the effect of currently available treatment options for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders on EPC biology will be discussed. The various EPC-based therapies that will be discussed include lipid-lowering agents, antihypertensive agents, antidiabetic drugs, phosphodiesteraze inhibitors, hormones, as well as EPC capturing stents.},

abstract = {Fluorescence anisotropy and linear dichroism imaging have been widely used for imaging biomolecular orienta- tional distributions in protein aggregates, fibrillar structures of cells, and cell membranes. However, these techniques do not give access to complete orientational order information in a whole image, because their use is limited to parts of the sample where the average orientation of molecules is known a priori. Fluorescence anisotropy is also highly sensitive to depolarization mecha- nisms such as those induced by fluorescence energy transfer. A fully excitation-polarization-resolved fluorescence microscopy imaging that relies on the use of a tunable incident polarization and a nonpolarized detection is able to circumvent these limita- tions. We have developed such a technique in confocal epifluorescence microscopy, giving access to new regions of study in the complex and heterogeneous molecular organization of cell membranes. Using this technique, we demonstrate morphological changes at the subdiffraction scale in labeled COS-7 cell membranes whose cytoskeleton is perturbed. Molecular orientational order is also seen to be affected by cholesterol depletion, reflecting the strong interplay between lipid-packing regions and their nearby cytoskeleton. This noninvasive optical technique can reveal local organization in cell membranes when used as a complement to existing methods such as generalized polarization.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are proteinaceous nano-scale linear aggregates. They are of key interest not only because of their association with numerous disorders, such as type II diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, but also because of their potential to become engineered high-performance nano-materials. Methods to characterise the length distribution of nano-scale linear aggregates such as amyloid fibrils are of paramount importance both in understanding the biological impact of these aggregates and in controlling their mechanical properties as potential nano-materials. Here, we present a new quantitative approach to the determination of the length distribution of amyloid fibrils using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy. The method described employs single-particle image analysis corrected for the length-dependent bias that is a common problem associated with surface-based imaging techniques. Applying this method, we provide a detailed characterisation of the length distribution of samples containing long-straight fibrils formed in vitro from $\beta$2-microglobulin. The results suggest that the Weibull distribution is a suitable model in describing fibril length distributions, and reveal that fibril fragmentation is an important process even under unagitated conditions. These results demonstrate the significance of quantitative length distribution measurements in providing important new information regarding amyloid assembly.},

Summary: quantification of fibril length distribution using AFM in different conditions

Methods
* generate sample with different seed concentrations and stirring conditions
* plating and AFM image analysis
* bias correction: assuming amount of monomers is equal in different samples and adjust measurements to correct for that
* MLE estimation to fit different distributions, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for assessing fit quality

Conclusions:
* Weibull (or gamma) distribution seem appropriate
* difference between samples 1 and 2 (diff seeding concentration, no stirring) suggests fibril fragmentation is significicant even when not stirring samples},

The reaction was previously studied using soluble tryptophanase, a kinetic mechanism proposed and the catalytic properties of the enzyme described. It is important, however, to determine the kinetic parameters of the reaction catalyzed by whole cells, if the process is to be designed with the catalyst in this form. The reaction stoichiometry was established, a mole of product being formed from a mole of each reactant, with no indication of side reactions under the conditions used. The two-substrate reaction kinetics were characterized and modelled, assuming an enzyme-substituted mechanism and no product inhibition. Theoretical consumption rates of indole were compared with experimental values obtained in a batch reactor system. The Kmvalues of whole cells towards L-serine and indole were 1.79 M and 0.07 M, respectively. These values are, as expected, considerably higher than their counterparts for soluble tryptophanase.},

Much of our knowledge about decision-making is derived from simple models, such as bacteriophage lambda infection, in which lambda chooses between the vegetative lytic fate and the dormant lysogenic fate. This paradigmatic system is broadly understood but lacking mechanistic details, partly due to limited resolution of past studies. Here, we discuss how modern technologies have enabled high-resolution examination of lambda decision-making to provide new insights and exciting possibilities in studying this classical system. The advent of techniques for labeling specific DNA, RNA, and proteins in cells allows for molecular-level characterization of events in lambda development. These capabilities yield both new answers and new questions regarding how the isolated lambda genetic circuit acts, what biological events transpire among phages in their natural context, and how the synergy of simple phage macromolecules brings about complex behaviors.},

abstract = {Microtubules are highly dynamic protein polymers that form a crucial part of the cytoskeleton in all eukaryotic cells. Although microtubules are known to self-assemble from tubulin dimers, information on the assembly dynamics of microtubules has been limited, both in vitro and in vivo, to measurements of average growth and shrinkage rates over several thousands of tubulin subunits. As a result there is a lack of information on the sequence of molecular events that leads to the growth and shrinkage of microtubule ends. Here we use optical tweezers to observe the assembly dynamics of individual microtubules at molecular resolution. We find that microtubules can increase their overall length almost instantaneously by amounts exceeding the size of individual dimers (8 nm). When the microtubule-associated protein XMAP215 (ref. 6) is added, this effect is markedly enhanced and fast increases in length of about 40-60 nm are observed. These observations suggest that small tubulin oligomers are able to add directly to growing microtubules and that XMAP215 speeds up microtubule growth by facilitating the addition of long oligomers. The achievement of molecular resolution on the microtubule assembly process opens the way to direct studies of the molecular mechanism by which the many recently discovered microtubule end-binding proteins regulate microtubule dynamics in living cells.},

abstract = {The type-III secretion effector YopO helps pathogenic Yersinia to outmaneuver the human immune system. Injected into host cells, it functions as a Ser/Thr kinase after activation by actin binding. This activation process is thought to involve large conformational changes. We use PELDOR spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering in combination with available crystal structures to study these conformational transitions. Low-resolution hybrid models of the YopO/actin structure in solution were constructed, where the kinase domain of YopO is tilted “backward” compared with the crystal structure, thus shortening the distance between actin and the kinase active site, potentially affecting the substrate specificity of YopO. Furthermore, the GDI domain of the hybrid models resembles a conformation that was previously observed in a crystal structure of the isolated GDI domain. We investigate possible structural reasons for the inactivity of the apo state, analyze its flexibility and discuss the biological implications. YopO/YpkA is a multifunctional type-III effector protein from Yersinia species, the causative agents of the plague. After its injection into host cells, YopO binds to actin. This activates the kinase activity of YopO. Peter et al. use an integrated approach of PELDOR spectroscopy and SAXS to shed light on the large conformational changes involved in this process.},

abstract = {Identification of drug–target interactions (DTIs) is critical for discovering potential target protein candidates for new drugs. However, traditional experimental methods have limitations in discovering DTIs. They are time-consuming, tedious, and expensive, and often suffer from high false-positive rates and false-negative rates. Therefore, using computational methods to predict DTIs has received extensive attention from many researchers in recent years. To address this issue, in this paper, an effective prediction model is presented which is based on the information of drug molecular structure data and protein sequence data. It performs prediction with the following procedures. First, we transform the sequences of each target into a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), such that the features can retain biological evolutionary information. We then use a feature vector of molecular substructure fingerprints to describe the chemical structure information of the drug compounds. Second, the Legendre moments algorithm is used to extract new features from the PSSM. Finally, a classification algorithm called rotation forest is used to perform prediction, we tested its prediction performance on four golden standard data sets: enzymes, G-protein-coupled receptors, ion channels, and nuclear receptors. As a result, the proposed method achieves average accuracies of 0.9026, 0.8260, 0.8703, and 0.7444 on these four data sets using five-fold cross-validation. We also compare the proposed method with the support vector machine and other existing approaches. The proposed model is proved to be superior to comparative methods, showing that it is feasible, effective, and robust for predicting potential DTI.},

abstract = {It is shown that adsorbability of T4 is regularly correlated with the extended state of the tail fibers, suggesting that in T4 fiber extension is a necessary condition for adsorption. Furthermore the extension and retraction of fibers is correlated with the dual sedimentation of T4 observed during ultracentrifugation. For T4, 38, which requires tryptophan for adsorption, electron microscopy shows the tail fibers to be extended in the presence of tryptophan and retracted in its absence. Phages with retracted fibers (no tryptophan) show a faster sedimentation than those with extended fibers (with tryptophan). In the absence of tryptophan T4, 38 does not show fiber extension even at pH 7, a condition sufficient for nontryptophan-requiring T4, whose fibers are retracted at pH 5. A conditional lethal mutation in gene 37 of phage T4D results in phages which lack tail fibers entirely. These phages no longer adsorb. In the ultracentrifuge, only the fast form can be observed whether at pH 7 or 5. Phages with extended fibers are more rapidly inactivated by ultrasonic waves than phages with retracted fibers. Measurements on electron micrographs show that the head size of T4 is invariant. A model of the functioning fiber apparatus is proposed and discussed. {\textcopyright} 1965.},

Nanocrystals were sprayed onto substrates as absorber layers in devices with several different architectures, including Schottky barrier, heterojunction, and organic/inorganic hybrid architectures, to explore their viability as a PV material. None of the devices exhibited PV response. XRD and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the pyrite composition and phase purity of the nanocrystals. The electrical conductivity of the nanocrystal films was about 4 to 5 S/cm, more typical of metal nanocrystal films than semiconductor nanocrystal films, and the lack of PV response appears to derive from the highly conductive surface-related defects in pyrite that have been proposed. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

All amyloid aggregates can give rise to potentially infectious seeds that accelerate their growth. Why some amyloid seeds are highly infectious prion particles while others are less infectious or even inert, is currently not understood. To address this question, we analyzed the suprastructure and dimensions of synthetic amyloid fibrils assembled from the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) prion protein Sup35NM. We then quantified the ability of these particles to induce the [PSI+] prion phenotype in cells. Our results show a striking relationship between the length distribution of the amyloid fibrils and their ability to induce the heritable [PSI+] prion phenotype. Using a simple particle size threshold model to describe transfection activity, we explain how dimensions of amyloid fibrils are able to modulate their infectious potential as prions.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Indole has many, diverse roles in bacterial signaling. It regulates the transition from exponential to stationary phase, it is involved in the control of plasmid stability, and it influences biofilm formation, virulence, and stress responses (including antibiotic resistance). Its role is not restricted to bacteria, and recently it has been shown to include mutually beneficial signaling between enteric bacteria and their mammalian hosts. In many respects indole behaves like the signaling component of a quorum-sensing system. Indole synthesized within the producer bacterium is exported into the surroundings where its accumulation is detected by sensitive cells. A view often repeated in the literature is that in Escherichia coli the AcrEF-TolC and Mtr transporter proteins are involved in the export and import, respectively, of indole. However, the evidence for their involvement is indirect, and it has been known for a long time that indole can pass directly through a lipid bilayer. We have combined in vivo and in vitro approaches to examine the relative importance of protein-mediated transport and direct passage across the E. coli membrane. We conclude that the movement of indole across the E. coli membrane under normal physiological conditions is independent of AcrEF-TolC and Mtr. Furthermore, direct observation of individual liposomes shows that indole can rapidly cross an E. coli lipid membrane without the aid of any proteinaceous transporter. These observations not only enhance our understanding of indole signaling in bacteria but also provide a simple explanation for the ability of indole to signal between biological kingdoms.},

Presently, lasers capable of generating terawatt peak powers with unprecedented short pulse duration can now be built on a single optical table in a small-scale laboratory, while large-scale lasers can generate peak power of over a petawatt. This progress is made possible by the use of the chirped-pulse amplification technique, combined with the use of broad-bandwidth laser materials such as Ti:sapphire, and the development of techniques for generating and propagating very short (10-30 fs) duration light pulses. We also briefly summarize some of the new scientific advances made possible by this technology, such as the generation of coherent femtosecond x-ray pulses, and the generation of MeV-energy electron beams and high-energy ions.

Informative disease models have revealed a plethora of abnormal tau species and mechanisms that might contribute to neuronal dysfunction and loss, but the relative importance of their respective contributions is uncertain. This knowledge gap poses major obstacles to the development of truly impactful therapeutic strategies. The current expansion and intensification of efforts to translate mechanistic insights into tau-related therapeutics should address this issue and could deliver better treatments for a host of devastating conditions.},

abstract = {The number of macromolecular structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank now approaches 100 000, with the vast majority of them determined by crystallographic methods. Thousands of papers describing such structures have been published in the scientific literature, and 20 Nobel Prizes in chemistry or medicine have been awarded for discoveries based on macromolecular crystallography. New hardware and software tools have made crystallography appear to be an almost routine (but still far from being analytical) technique and many structures are now being determined by scientists with very limited experience in the practical aspects of the field. However, this apparent ease is sometimes illusory and proper procedures need to be followed to maintain high standards of structure quality. In addition, many noncrystallographers may have problems with the critical evaluation and interpretation of structural results published in the scientific literature. The present review provides an outline of the technical aspects of crystallography for less experienced practitioners, as well as information that might be useful for users of macromolecular structures, aiming to show them how to interpret (but not overinterpret) the information present in the coordinate files and in their description. A discussion of the extent of information that can be gleaned from the atomic coordinates of structures solved at different resolution is provided, as well as problems and pitfalls encountered in structure determination and interpretation. This review, addressed to the less experienced macromolecular crystallographers and to users of biological structures, provides an outline of the technical aspects of crystallography, and discusses common problems and pitfalls encountered during structure determination and interpretation. It includes tips on how to interpret, but not overinterpret, the information present in the coordinate files and in their description. {\textcopyright} 2013 FEBS.},

FAD mutations increase the release of amyloid $\beta$2 (A$\beta$2)42 relative to A$\beta$240 by an unknown, possibly gain-of-toxic- function, mechanism. However, many PSEN mutations paradoxically impair $\gamma$-secretase and loss-of-functiong mechanisms have also been postulated. Here, we use kinetic studies to demonstrate that FAD mutations affect A$\beta$2 generation via three different mechanisms, resulting in qualitative changes in the A$\beta$2 profiles, which are not limited to A$\beta$242. Loss of $\epsilon$-cleavage function is not generally observed among FAD mutants. On the other hand, $\gamma$-secretase inhibitors used in the clinic appear to block the initial $\epsilon$-cleavage step, but unexpectedly affect more selectively Notch than APP processing, while modulators act as activators of the carboxypeptidase-like ($\gamma$) activity. Overall, we provide a coherent explanation for the effect of different FAD mutations, demonstrating the importance of qualitative rather than quantitative changes in the A$\beta$2 products, and suggest fundamental improvements for current drug development efforts. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

abstract = {Cell migration is fundamental to establishing and maintaining the proper organization of multicellular organisms. Morphogenesis can be viewed as a consequence, in part, of cell locomotion, from large-scale migrations of epithelial sheets during gastrulation, to the movement of individual cells during development of the nervous system. In an adult organism, cell migration is essential for proper immune response, wound repair, and tissue homeostasis, while aberrant cell migration is found in various pathologies. Indeed, as our knowledge of migration increases, we can look forward to, for example, abating the spread of highly malignant cancer cells, retarding the invasion of white cells in the inflammatory process, or enhancing the healing of wounds. This article is organized in two main sections. The first section is devoted to the single-cell migrating in isolation such as occurs when leukocytes migrate during the immune response or when fibroblasts squeeze through connective tissue. The second section is devoted to cells collectively migrating as part of multicellular clusters or sheets. This second type of migration is prevalent in development, wound healing, and in some forms of cancer metastasis. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physiological Society},

abstract = {The fascination for lanthanide optical spectroscopy dates back to the 1880s when renowned scientists such as Sir William Crookes, LeCoq de Boisbaudran, Eug{\`{e}}ne Demar{\c{c}}ay or, later, Georges Urbain were using luminescence as an analytical tool to test the purity of their crystallizations and to identify potential new elements. The richness and complexity of lanthanide optical spectra are reflected in an article published in 1937 by J.H. van Vleck: The Puzzle of Rare Earth Spectra in Solids. After this analytical and exploratory period, lanthanide unique optical properties were taken advantage of in optical glasses, filters, and lasers. In the mid-1970s, E. Soini and I. Hemmil{\"{a}} proposed lanthanide luminescent probes for time-resolved immunoassays (Soini and Hemmil{\"{a}} in Clin Chem 25:353–361, 1979) and this has been the starting point of the present numerous bio-applications based on optical properties of lanthanides. In this chapter, we first briefly outline the principles underlying the simplest models used for describing the electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of trivalent lanthanide ions LnIII (4f n ) with special emphasis on luminescence. Since the book is intended for a broad readership within the sciences, we start from scratch defining all quantities used, but we stay at a descriptive level, leaving out detailed mathematical developments. For the latter, the reader is referred to references Liu and Jacquier, Spectroscopic properties of rare earths in optical materials.

In: Gschneidner, Eyring (eds) Handbook on the physics and chemistry of rare earths, vol 23. Elsevier BV, Amsterdam, Ch 155, 1996. The second part of the chapter is devoted to practical aspects of lanthanide luminescent probes, both from the point of view of their design and of their potential utility.},

abstract = {Several methods to rotate and align microscopic particles controllably have been developed. Control of the orientation of a trapped particle allows full three dimensional manipulation, whereas rotating particles are tools for the development of optically-driven micromachines. It has been shown that the orientation of an object in the laser trap depends on its birefringence as well as on its shape. The effect of shape is often referred to as form-birefringence. We report on the trapping, rotation, and in-situ growth of birefringent tetragonal lysozyme crystals in optical tweezers operating at a wavelength of 1064 nm. Variation of the temperature, pH and lysozyme concentration of the solution during growth was used to alter the size, as well as the length to width ratio of the crystals, and hence their orientation in the tweezers. Thus this system serves as a model to study the relative importance of birefringence versus form-birefringence for particle orientation. Crystals with the optical axis skewed or perpendicular to the trapping-beam axis could be rotated by changing the orientation of linearly polarized light. We observed spontaneous spinning of some asymmetric crystals in the presence of linearly polarized light, due to radiation pressure effects. Addition of protein to the solution in the tweezers permitted real-time observation of crystal growth.},

In addition to confirmation of basic nomenclature, several additional concepts were discussed, which are used in scientific amyloid literature. Among such concepts are cytotoxic oligomers, protofibrils, primary and secondary nucleation, seeding and cross-seeding, amyloid signature proteins, and amyloid plaques. Recommendations for their use are given. Definitions of amyloid and amyloidosis are confirmed. Possible novel human amyloid fibril proteins, appearing as ‘classical' in vivo amyloid, were discussed. It was decided to include fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (amyloid protein: AEFEMP1), which appears as localised amyloid in portal veins. There are several possible amyloid proteins under investigation, and these are included in a new Table.},

The illuminated point is then focused as an image of the point upon a pinhole aperture, and the light intensity of the image measured by a photosensitive device. While the optical system remains fixed, means are provided to move the specimen in a selected pattern across the focal point of illumination so that a selected area of the specimen traverses and is examined by the point of light. This scanning pattern traversed by the specimen is reproduced by an identical scanning pattern or raster upon a display device, such as a cathode ray tube, to which is also fed the signal from the photosensitive device. The raster area greatly exceeds the selected area of the specimen. As a result, an image of the second specimen area is reproduced on a highly enlarged scale in the raster of the cathode ray tube.},

Although the individual concepts are simple, there are many concepts to learn and retain simultaneously; this situation may give the illusion that learning the physics of MR imaging is complicated. It is important for the radiologist who interprets MR images to understand the methods used to create the images because image contrast specifically depends on how the image data were acquired. Initial concepts include formation of magnetic fields from electric currents in loops of wire, the resonance phenomenon, the hydrogen proton and its frequency of precession, and absorption of radiofrequency energy. These concepts can then be applied to learn about T1 and T2 relaxation and contrast and how the acquisition parameters of echo time and repetition time can be used to achieve these image contrasts. Basic pulse sequences include the spin-echo, multiecho spin-echo, turbo spin-echo, inversion-recovery, and gradient-recalled-echo sequences.},

abstract = {The evaluation of cytoskeletal bundling is a fundamental experimental method in the field of cell biology. Although the skewness of the pixel intensity distribution derived from fluorescently-labeled cytoskeletons has been widely used as a metric to evaluate the degree of bundling in digital microscopy images, its versatility has not been fully validated. Here, we applied the coefficient of variation (CV) of intensity values as an alternative metric, and compared its performance with skewness. In synthetic images representing extremely bundled conditions, the CV successfully detected degrees of bundling that could not be distinguished by skewness. On actual microscopy images, CV was better than skewness, especially on variable-angle epifluorescence microscopic images or stimulated emission depletion and confocal microscopy images of very small areas of around 1 $\mu$m2. When blur or noise was added to synthetic images, CV was found to be robust to blur but deleteriously affected by noise, whereas skewness was robust to noise but deleteriously affected by blur. For confocal images, CV and skewness showed similar sensitivity to noise, possibly because optical blurring is often present in microscopy images. Therefore, in practical use with actual microscopy images, CV may be more appropriate than skewness, unless the image is extremely noisy.},

These organelles play key biological roles, by compartmentalizing the cell to enable spatiotemporal control of biological reactions. Recent studies suggest that membrane-less intracellular compartments are multicomponent viscous liquid droplets that form via phase separation. Proteins that have an intrinsic tendency for being conformationally heterogeneous seem to be the main drivers of liquid-liquid phase separation in the cell. These findings highlight the relevance of classical concepts from the physics of polymeric phase transitions for understanding the assembly of intracellular membrane-less compartments. However, applying these concepts is challenging, given the heteropolymeric nature of protein sequences, the complex intracellular environment, and non-equilibrium features intrinsic to cells. This provides new opportunities for adapting established theories and for the emergence of new physics.},

The original concept is based on the association of a large field of view scintillator optically coupled with an array of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), in order to locate the position of interactions inside the crystal. Using a dedicated accessory, like a parallel hole collimator, to focus the field of view toward a predefined direction, it is possible to built up an image of the radioactive distribution. In terms of imaging performances, three main characteristics are commonly considered: uniformity, spatial resolution and energy resolution. Major improvements were mainly due to progress in terms of industrial process regarding analogical electronic, crystal growing or PMTs manufacturing. Today's gamma camera is highly digital, from the PMTs to the display. All the corrections are applied "on the fly" using up to date signal processing techniques. At the same time some significant progresses have been achieved in the field of collimators. Finally, two new technologies have been implemented, solid detectors like CdTe or CdZnTe, and pixellized scintillators plus photodiodes or position sensitive photomultiplier tubes. These solutions are particularly well adapted to build dedicated gamma camera for breast or intraoperative imaging. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

DNA points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) offers an easy-to-implement approach to localization-based super-resolution microscopy, owing to the use of DNA probes. In DNA-PAINT, transient binding of short dye-labeled ('imager') oligonucleotides to their complementary target ('docking') strands creates the necessary 'blinking' to enable stochastic super-resolution microscopy. Using the programmability and specificity of DNA molecules as imaging and labeling probes allows researchers to decouple blinking from dye photophysics, alleviating limitations of current super-resolution techniques, making them compatible with virtually any single-molecule-compatible dye. Recent developments in DNA-PAINT have enabled spectrally unlimited multiplexing, precise molecule counting and ultra-high, molecular-scale (sub-5-nm) spatial resolution, reaching 1/41-nm localization precision. DNA-PAINT can be applied to a multitude of in vitro and cellular applications by linking docking strands to antibodies. Here, we present a protocol for the key aspects of the DNA-PAINT framework for both novice and expert users. This protocol describes the creation of DNA origami test samples, in situ sample preparation, multiplexed data acquisition, data simulation, super-resolution image reconstruction and post-processing such as drift correction, molecule counting (qPAINT) and particle averaging. Moreover, we provide an integrated software package, named Picasso, for the computational steps involved. The protocol is designed to be modular, so that individual components can be chosen and implemented per requirements of a specific application. The procedure can be completed in 1-2 d.},

abstract = {Integrins are transmembrane receptors that, upon activation, bind extracellular ligands and link them to the actin filament (F-actin) cytoskeleton to mediate cell adhesion and migration. Cytoskeletal forces in migrating cells generated by polymerization- or contractility-driven “retrograde flow” of F-actin from the cell leading edge have been hypothesized to mediate integrin activation for ligand binding. This predicts that these forces should align and orient activated, ligand-bound integrins at the leading edge. Here, polarization-sensitive fluorescence microscopy of GFP-$\alpha$V$\beta$3 integrins in fibroblasts shows that integrins are coaligned in a specific orientation within focal adhesions (FAs) in a manner dependent on binding immobilized ligand and a talin-mediated linkage to the F-actin cytoskeleton. These findings, together with Rosetta modeling, suggest that integrins in FA are coaligned and may be highly tilted by cytoskeletal forces. Thus, the F-actin cytoskeleton sculpts an anisotropic molecular scaffold in FAs, and this feature may underlie the ability of migrating cells to sense directional extracellular cues.},

Here, we report characterization of Cpf1, a putative class 2 CRISPR effector. We demonstrate that Cpf1 mediates robust DNA interference with features distinct from Cas9. Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease lacking tracrRNA, and it utilizes a T-rich protospacer-adjacent motif. Moreover, Cpf1 cleaves DNA via a staggered DNA double-stranded break. Out of 16 Cpf1-family proteins, we identified two candidate enzymes from Acidaminococcus and Lachnospiraceae, with efficient genome-editing activity in human cells. Identifying this mechanism of interference broadens our understanding of CRISPR-Cas systems and advances their genome editing applications.},

abstract = {Circumferential skin creases (CSC-KT) is a rare polymalformative syndrome characterised by intellectual disability associated with skin creases on the limbs, and very characteristic craniofacial malformations. Previously, heterozygous and homozygous mutations in MAPRE2 were found to be causal for this disease. MAPRE2 encodes for a member of evolutionary conserved microtubule plus end tracking proteins, the end binding (EB) family. Unlike MAPRE1 and MAPRE3, MAPRE2 is not required for the persistent growth and stabilization of microtubules, but plays a role in other cellular processes such as mitotic progression and regulation of cell adhesion. The mutations identified in MAPRE2 all reside within the calponin homology domain, responsible to track and interact with the plus-end tip of growing microtubules, and previous data showed that altered dosage of MAPRE2 resulted in abnormal branchial arch patterning in zebrafish. In this study, we developed patient derived induced pluripotent stem cell lines for MAPRE2, together with isogenic controls, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and differentiated them towards neural crest cells with cranial identity. We show that changes in MAPRE2 lead to alterations in neural crest migration in vitro but also in vivo, following xenotransplantation of neural crest progenitors into developing chicken embryos. In addition, we provide evidence that changes in focal adhesion might underlie the altered cell motility of the MAPRE2 mutant cranial neural crest cells. Our data provide evidence that MAPRE2 is involved in cellular migration of cranial neural crest and offers critical insights into the mechanism underlying the craniofacial dysmorphisms and cleft palate present in CSC-KT patients. This adds the CSC-KT disorder to the growing list of neurocristopathies.},

abstract = {The amyloid cascade hypothesis, according to which the self-assembly of amyloid-$\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$) is a causative process in Alzheimer's disease, has driven many therapeutic efforts for the past 20 years. Failures of clinical trials investigating A$\beta$-targeted therapies have been interpreted as evidence against this hypothesis, irrespective of the characteristics and mechanisms of action of the therapeutic agents, which are highly challenging to assess. Here, we combine kinetic analyses with quantitative binding measurements to address the mechanism of action of four clinical stage anti-A$\beta$ antibodies, aducanumab, gantenerumab, bapineuzumab and solanezumab. We quantify the influence of these antibodies on the aggregation kinetics and on the production of oligomeric aggregates and link these effects to the affinity and stoichiometry of each antibody for monomeric and fibrillar forms of A$\beta$. Our results reveal that, uniquely among these four antibodies, aducanumab dramatically reduces the flux of A$\beta$ oligomers.},

* failure of amyloid cascade-targeting drugs is not evidence against that hypothesis
* characterised binding kinetics of different drugs. only one of them seemed to do anything},

abstract = {Phage therapy is the clinical or veterinary application of bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) as antibacterial "drugs." More generally, phages can be used as biocontrol agents against plant as well as foodborne pathogens. In this chapter, we consider the therapeutic use of phage cocktails, which is the combining of two or more phage types to produce more pharmacologically diverse formulations. The primary motivation for the use of cocktails is their broader spectra of activity in comparison to individual phage isolates: they can impact either more bacterial types or achieve effectiveness under a greater diversity of conditions. The combining of phages can also facilitate better targeting of multiple strains making up individual bacterial species or covering multiple species that might be responsible for similar disease states, in general providing, relative to individual phage isolates, a greater potential for presumptive or empirical treatment. Contrasting the use of phage banks, or even phage isolation against specific etiologies that have been obtained directly from patients under treatment, here we consider the utility as well as potential shortcomings associated with the use of phage cocktails as therapeutic antibacterial agents. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has become established as a diagnostic and research tool in many areas of medicine because of its ability to provide excellent soft-tissue delineation in different areas of interest. In addition to T1- and T2-weighted imaging, many specialized MR techniques have been designed to extract metabolic or biophysical information. Diffusion-weighted imaging gives insight into the movement of water molecules in tissue, and diffusion-tensor imaging can reveal fiber orientation in the white matter tracts. Metabolic information about the object of interest can be obtained with spectroscopy of protons, in addition to imaging of other nuclei, such as sodium. Dynamic contrast material-enhanced imaging and recently proton spectroscopy play an important role in oncologic imaging. When these techniques are combined, they can assist the physician in making a diagnosis or monitoring a treatment regimen. One of the major advantages of the different types of MR imaging is the ability of the operator to manipulate image contrast with a variety of selectable parameters that affect the kind and quality of the information provided. The elements used to obtain MR images and the factors that affect formation of an MR image include MR instrumentation, localization of the MR signal, gradients, k-space, and pulse sequences.},

abstract = {Imaging of microbial interactions has so far been based on well-established electron microscopy methods. This study presents a new way to study bacterial colonies and interactions between bacteria and their viruses, bacteriophages (phages), in situ on agar plates using helium ion microscopy (HIM). In biological imaging, HIM has advantages over traditional scanning electron microscopy with its sub-nanometer resolution, increased surface sensitivity, and the possibility to image nonconductive samples. Furthermore, by controlling the He beam dose or by using heavier Ne ions, the HIM instrument provides the possibility to mill out material in the samples, allowing for subsurface imaging and in situ sectioning. Here, the first HIM-images of bacterial colonies and phage–bacterium interactions are presented at different stages of the infection as they occur on an agar culture. The feasibility of neon and helium milling is also demonstrated to reveal the subsurface structures of bacterial colonies on agar substrate, and in some cases also structure inside individual bacteria after cross-sectioning. The study concludes that HIM offers great opportunities to advance the studies of microbial imaging, in particular in the area of interaction of viruses with cells.},

abstract = {Existing models for bacteriophage adsorption are modified with the addition of a new term, adsorption efficiency, and applied to a T4–Escherichia coli system. The adsorption efficiency is the fraction of phage that adsorbs irreversibly to the host. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using the adsorption rate constant (k) and the adsorption efficiency ($\epsilon$). Experimental data demonstrated that the adsorption rate constant depends strongly on the condition of the host while the adsorption efficiency is a property of the bacteriophage population. The adsorption efficiency exhibited a marked dependence on the concentration of l-tryptophan. The system was used to study the effect of adsorption kinetics on bacteriophage amplification. Increasing adsorption efficiency had an effect similar to increasing the initial multiplicity of infection; the number of phages produced during amplification decreased. Optimizing the adsorption efficiency by manipulating the l-tryptophan concentration yielded a 14-fold increase in the number of phages produced.},

Our approach calculates optimal linear filters for the 3D reconstruction by embedding helical symmetry operators in Fourier-space, and deals with deviations from perfect helical symmetry through Gaussian-shaped priors on the orientations of individual segments. By incorporating our approach into the standard pipeline for single-particle analysis in RELION, our implementation aims to be easily accessible for non-experienced users. Although our implementation does not solve the problem that grossly incorrect structures can be obtained when the wrong helical symmetry is imposed, we show for four different test cases that it is capable of reconstructing structures to near-atomic resolution.},

abstract = {The deposition of amyloid-like filaments in the brain is the central event in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we report cellular models of intracytoplasmic inclusions of $\alpha$-synuclein, generated by introducing nucleation seeds into SH-SY5Y cells with a transfection reagent. Upon introduction of preformed seeds into cells overexpressing $\alpha$-synuclein, abundant, highly filamentous $\alpha$-synuclein-positive inclusions, which are extensively phosphorylated and ubiquitinated and partially thioflavin-positive, were formed within the cells. SH-SY5Y cells that formed such inclusions underwent cell death, which was blocked by small molecular compounds that inhibit $\beta$-sheet formation. Similar seed-dependent aggregation was observed in cells expressing four-repeat Tau by introducing four-repeat Tau fibrils but not three-repeat Tau fibrils or $\alpha$-synuclein fibrils. No aggregate formation was observed in cells overexpressing three-repeat Tau upon treatment with four-repeat Tau fibrils. Our cellular models thus provide evidence of nucleation-dependent and protein-specific polymerization of intracellular amyloid-like proteins in cultured cells. {\textcopyright} 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},
